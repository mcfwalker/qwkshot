# Environmental Analyzer

## Overview
The Environmental Analyzer is a core component of the Prompt-to-Path (P2P) pipeline that analyzes the spatial environment around a 3D object. It works in conjunction with the Scene Analyzer to provide precise measurements and constraints for camera path generation. The environment is modeled as a cubed volume with the object centered on its floor plane.

## Status
⚠️ **Current Status**: Functional but with storage issues
- Data persistence challenges with metadata storage
- Complex nested structure handling needs optimization
- Integration with metadata storage requires refinement

## Features

### 1. Environment Analysis
- Environment bounds calculation
- Object positioning and dimensions
- Distance measurements from object to boundaries
- Camera positioning constraints

### 2. Spatial Measurements
- Object bounding box analysis
- Reference point calculations
- Distance to boundary measurements
- Height-based constraints

### 3. Camera Constraints
- Minimum and maximum camera heights
- Safe distance calculations
- Movement boundary validation
- Position constraints

## Known Issues
1. **Data Persistence**
   - Environment data not consistently stored in database
   - Complex nested structure causing storage issues
   - Integration with metadata storage needs optimization

2. **Integration Challenges**
   - Complex data structure handling
   - Database operation efficiency
   - Error handling enhancement needed

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { EnvironmentalAnalyzerImpl } from '@/features/p2p/environmental-analyzer/EnvironmentalAnalyzer';
import { EnvironmentalAnalyzerConfig } from '@/types/p2p';

// Create analyzer instance
const config: EnvironmentalAnalyzerConfig = {
  environmentSize: {
    width: 100,  // Environment width in units
    height: 100, // Environment height in units
    depth: 100   // Environment depth in units
  },
  analysisOptions: {
    calculateDistances: true,
    validateConstraints: true,
    optimizeCameraSpace: true
  },
  debug: false,
  performanceMonitoring: true,
  errorReporting: true
};

const analyzer = new EnvironmentalAnalyzerImpl(config, logger);

// Analyze environment with scene analysis
const analysis = await analyzer.analyzeEnvironment(sceneAnalysis);

// Get environment measurements
const measurements = await analyzer.getEnvironmentMeasurements(analysis);

// Get camera constraints
const constraints = await analyzer.getCameraConstraints(analysis);
```

### Advanced Usage
```typescript
// Get detailed distance measurements
const distances = await analyzer.getDistanceMeasurements(analysis);

// Validate camera position
const isValid = await analyzer.validateCameraPosition(analysis, {
  position: new Vector3(10, 5, 10),
  target: new Vector3(0, 0, 0)
});

// Get recommended camera ranges
const ranges = await analyzer.getCameraRanges(analysis);
```

## Integration

### Scene Analyzer Integration
```typescript
// Combine Scene and Environmental analysis
const sceneAnalysis = await sceneAnalyzer.analyzeScene(file);
const environmentalAnalysis = await environmentalAnalyzer.analyzeEnvironment(sceneAnalysis);

// Get comprehensive spatial understanding
const understanding = {
  ...sceneAnalysis,
  environment: environmentalAnalysis,
};
```

### Viewer Integration
```typescript
// Apply environmental constraints to viewer
viewer.applyEnvironmentalConstraints(environmentalAnalysis);

// Update viewer settings based on analysis
viewer.updateSettings({
  cameraConstraints: environmentalAnalysis.cameraConstraints,
  movementBounds: environmentalAnalysis.movementBounds,
});
```
