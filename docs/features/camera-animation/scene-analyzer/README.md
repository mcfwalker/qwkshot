# Scene Analyzer

## Overview
The Scene Analyzer is a core component of the Prompt-to-Path (P2P) pipeline that analyzes 3D scenes to extract meaningful information for camera path generation and animation. It processes GLB files to understand spatial relationships, identify features, calculate safety boundaries, and determine optimal camera start positions.

## Status
âœ… **Current Status**: Fully functional
- Core analysis features working as expected
- Integration with Environmental Analyzer complete
- Performance metrics established

- Animation path validation

### 2. Spatial Analysis

## Integration

### Interaction with Other Components
- The `SceneAnalyzer` typically runs once when a model is uploaded or processed.
- Its primary output, the `SceneAnalysis` object (containing spatial data, features, etc.), is stored persistently, usually via the `MetadataManager`.
- Downstream components in the P2P pipeline (like the `/api/camera-path` route and ultimately the `SceneInterpreter`) retrieve the stored `SceneAnalysis` via the `MetadataManager` to get the necessary geometric context for path generation. 
- The `EnvironmentalAnalyzer` also uses the `SceneAnalysis` data as input when it runs (typically when the user locks the scene).

```typescript
// Conceptual Flow:
// 1. Model Upload/Processing Time:
// const sceneAnalysis = await sceneAnalyzer.analyzeScene(glbFile);
// await metadataManager.storeSceneAnalysis(modelId, sceneAnalysis);

// 2. Later, during Path Generation request (/api/camera-path):
// const sceneAnalysis = await metadataManager.getSceneAnalysis(modelId);
// const environmentalAnalysis = await environmentalAnalyzer.analyzeEnvironment(sceneAnalysis, currentCameraState); 
// const commands = sceneInterpreter.interpretPath(motionPlan, sceneAnalysis, environmentalAnalysis, ...);
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
*Note: While the SceneAnalyzer can be instantiated and used directly as shown below, within the V3 P2P pipeline, it is typically invoked once during model upload/processing. The resulting `SceneAnalysis` object is then stored via the `MetadataManager` and retrieved by the API route when needed for path generation.*

```typescript
import { SceneAnalyzerImpl } from '@/features/p2p/scene-analyzer/SceneAnalyzer';
import { SceneAnalyzerConfig } from '@/types/p2p';

// Create analyzer instance
const config: SceneAnalyzerConfig = {
  maxFileSize: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100MB
  supportedFormats: ['model/gltf-binary'],
  analysisOptions: {
    extractFeatures: true,
    calculateSymmetry: true,
    analyzeMaterials: true,
    optimizeStartPosition: true,
    validateAnimationPath: true
  },
  debug: false,
  performanceMonitoring: true,
  errorReporting: true,
  maxRetries: 3,
  timeout: 30000,
};

const analyzer = new SceneAnalyzerImpl(config, logger);

// Analyze a GLB file
const analysis = await analyzer.analyzeScene(glbFile);

// Extract reference points
const points = await analyzer.extractReferencePoints(analysis);

// Calculate safety boundaries
const safety = await analyzer.calculateSafetyBoundaries(analysis);

// Get scene understanding
const understanding = await analyzer.getSceneUnderstanding(analysis);
```

### Advanced Usage
```typescript
// Validate analysis results
const validation = analyzer.validateAnalysis(analysis);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  console.error('Analysis validation failed:', validation.errors);
}

// Get performance metrics
const metrics = analyzer.getPerformanceMetrics();
console.log('Analysis duration:', metrics.duration);
```

## Implementation Details
