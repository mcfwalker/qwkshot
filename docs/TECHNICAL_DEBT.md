# Technical Debt & Future Improvements

## Authentication & Session Management

### Cookie Handling in Server Components
- **Issue**: Next.js warning about synchronous cookie access in server components
- **Location**: Multiple server components, including `/library` route
- **Warning Message**: `cookies()` should be awaited before using its value
- **Impact**: Low - Warning only, functionality still works
- **Fix Required**: 
  - Update server components to handle cookie access asynchronously
  - Implement proper async patterns for `createServerClient`
  - Reference: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis
- **Priority**: Low

## Development Environment

### Terminal Interaction Issues
- **Issue**: Development server interruptions during AI assistant interactions
- **Location**: Terminal/development environment
- **Current Workaround**: Running server in background mode (`npm run dev &`)
- **Impact**: Medium - Affects development workflow
- **Future Improvement**:
  - Consider implementing a more robust development server script
  - Add process management for background services
  - Improve terminal handling in AI assistant context

### Environment Variable Validation
- **Status**: Implemented and working
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Client-side validation of Supabase credentials
  - Server-side environment checks
  - Automatic validation on startup
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add more comprehensive validation
  - Implement structured logging
  - Add environment setup verification tools

## Current Workarounds
- Using synchronous cookie access in server components
- Running development server in background mode
- Manual monitoring of health checks
- Warning appears in console but doesn't affect functionality
- Authentication and session management still working as expected

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper async cookie handling
2. Update server component data fetching patterns
3. Consider implementing a more robust error boundary system
4. Add proper loading states for authentication transitions
5. Improve development server management
6. Enhance environment validation system
7. Add automated health check reporting

## Branch Management
- Current stable branch established from commit `2b45a92`
- Need to plan migration strategy for feature branches
- Consider making `stable` the default branch
- Document process for handling legacy code

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Cookie Handling in Next.js Routes
**Status**: Open
**Priority**: High
**Impact**: Warning messages in logs and potential performance impact
**Description**: Routes using `cookies()` are not properly awaiting the result
**Location**: `/library` route
**Error Message**: `Route "/library" used cookies().get('sb-mmoqqgsamsewsbocqxbi-auth-token'). cookies() should be awaited before using its value.`
**Fix Required**: Update cookie handling to use async/await pattern
