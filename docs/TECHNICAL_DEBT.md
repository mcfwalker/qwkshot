# Technical Debt & Future Improvements

## Authentication & Session Management

### Cookie Handling in Server Components
- **Issue**: Next.js warning about synchronous cookie access in server components
- **Location**: Multiple server components, including `/library` route
- **Warning Message**: `cookies()` should be awaited before using its value
- **Impact**: Low - Warning only, functionality still works
- **Fix Required**: 
  - Update server components to handle cookie access asynchronously
  - Implement proper async patterns for `createServerClient`
  - Reference: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis
- **Priority**: Low

## Current Workarounds
- Using synchronous cookie access in server components
- Warning appears in console but doesn't affect functionality
- Authentication and session management still working as expected

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper async cookie handling
2. Update server component data fetching patterns
3. Consider implementing a more robust error boundary system
4. Add proper loading states for authentication transitions
