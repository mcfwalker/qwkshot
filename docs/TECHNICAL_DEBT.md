# Technical Debt & Future Improvements

## Authentication & Session Management

### ~~Cookie Handling in Server Components~~ (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: ~~Next.js warning about synchronous cookie access in server components~~
- **Location**: ~~Multiple server components, including `/library` route~~
- **Warning Message**: ~~`cookies()` should be awaited before using its value~~
- **Impact**: ~~Low - Warning only, functionality still works~~
- ~~**Fix Required**:~~ 
  - ~~Update server components to handle cookie access asynchronously~~
  - ~~Implement proper async patterns for `createServerClient`~~
  - ~~Reference: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis~~
- ~~**Priority**: Low~~
- **Status**: RESOLVED on March 24, 2025 (see [Status Report M3DV-SR-2025-03-24-1557](./status-reports/M3DV-SR-2025-03-24-1557.md))
- **Solution**: Updated `createServerClient` in `src/lib/supabase-server.ts` to properly await cookies and implemented a custom cookie handler to ensure proper async cookie access

## Development Environment

### Terminal Interaction Issues
- **Issue**: Development server interruptions during AI assistant interactions
- **Location**: Terminal/development environment
- **Current Workaround**: Running server in background mode (`npm run dev &`)
- **Impact**: Medium - Affects development workflow
- **Future Improvement**:
  - Consider implementing a more robust development server script
  - Add process management for background services
  - Improve terminal handling in AI assistant context

### Environment Variable Validation
- **Status**: Implemented and working
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Client-side validation of Supabase credentials
  - Server-side environment checks
  - Automatic validation on startup
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Add more comprehensive validation
  - Implement structured logging
  - Add environment setup verification tools

## Current Workarounds
- ~~Using synchronous cookie access in server components~~
- Running development server in background mode
- Manual monitoring of health checks
- ~~Warning appears in console but doesn't affect functionality~~
- Authentication and session management still working as expected

## Future Improvements
1. ~~Implement proper async cookie handling~~
2. Update server component data fetching patterns
3. Consider implementing a more robust error boundary system
4. Add proper loading states for authentication transitions
5. Improve development server management
6. Enhance environment validation system
7. Add automated health check reporting

## Branch Management
- Current stable branch established from commit `2b45a92`
- Need to plan migration strategy for feature branches
- Consider making `stable` the default branch
- Document process for handling legacy code

## High Priority Issues

### ~~1. Cookie Handling in Next.js Routes~~ (RESOLVED)
**Status**: ~~Open~~ Resolved
**Priority**: ~~High~~ Completed
**Impact**: ~~Warning messages in logs and potential performance impact~~
**Description**: ~~Routes using `cookies()` are not properly awaiting the result~~
**Location**: ~~`/library` route~~
**Error Message**: ~~`Route "/library" used cookies().get('sb-mmoqqgsamsewsbocqxbi-auth-token'). cookies() should be awaited before using its value.`~~
**Fix Required**: ~~Update cookie handling to use async/await pattern~~
**Resolution**: Fixed in commit 571ec45 by:
- Updated `createServerClient` to properly await cookie access
- Implemented custom cookie handler for proper async access

### Performance Optimization: OrbitControls Event Listeners
**Status**: Open
**Priority**: Low
**Impact**: Performance warning in console, potential scroll responsiveness
**Description**: Non-passive event listeners on wheel events in OrbitControls
**Location**: `OrbitControls.js:311`
**Warning Message**: `Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'wheel' event`
**Fix Required**: Update wheel event listeners to use passive option
**Reference**: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5745543795965952
**Notes**:
- Third-party library (Three.js OrbitControls)
- Consider either:
  1. Forking and modifying OrbitControls
  2. Wrapping with custom implementation
  3. Waiting for upstream fix
**Priority**: Low - Warning only, functionality not affected
