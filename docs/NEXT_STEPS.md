## Current Priorities
1. Implement thin LLM Engine wrapper
2. Move animation logic to Scene Interpreter
3. Add basic validation layer
4. Clean up existing implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### Branching Strategy
- Create feature branches for each phase
  ```
  main
  ├── feature/thin-llm-engine
  │   ├── feat/basic-interface
  │   ├── feat/validation-layer
  │   └── feat/cleanup
  ├── feature/scene-interpreter
  │   ├── feat/base-structure
  │   ├── feat/animation-logic
  │   └── feat/path-processing
  └── feature/ui-refactor
      ├── feat/core-interactions
      └── feat/visual-feedback
  ```

### Development Workflow
1. **Phase-Based Development**
   - Work in feature branches for each phase
   - Create smaller feature branches for specific tasks
   - Regular merges back to phase branch
   - PR reviews for each feature

2. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Start with thin LLM Engine (most isolated)
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Parallel development possible between phases

3. **Feature Flag Strategy**
   - Enable/disable new implementations
   - Control rollout of features
   - A/B testing capability
   - Easy rollback if needed

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for new components
   - Integration tests for phase completion
   - E2E tests for critical paths
   - Performance benchmarks

### Phase 1 Implementation Plan
1. Create `feature/thin-llm-engine` branch
2. Implement features in order:
   - Basic interface
   - Validation layer
   - Cleanup
3. Regular merges to main
4. Feature flag control for rollout

## Architectural Decisions
- Keep provider logic in API routes
- Maintain thin LLM Engine approach
- Separate business logic from UI
- Focus on clean interfaces

## Blockers and Issues
- None currently identified, but careful coordination needed during refactor

## Next Session Focus
1. Begin thin LLM Engine implementation
2. Define interface boundaries
3. Plan animation logic migration
4. Set up validation framework

*This document will be updated at the end of each session to reflect progress and adjust priorities.*
