# UI Polish and Camera Controls Update

## Summary
Completed several UI improvements and restored camera recording functionality in the viewer panel.

## Achievements
1. UI Styling Updates:
   - Adjusted tab styles and weights
   - Fixed panel height consistency between Upload and Library tabs
   - Added purple divider lines between library items
   - Updated model title text sizes to match tab titles
   - Simplified button UI by removing text labels

2. Camera Controls:
   - Restored video recording functionality
   - Implemented icon-only buttons for play/pause, record, and reset
   - Fixed animation pause functionality with proper progress tracking

## Challenges
1. Panel Height Consistency:
   - Required careful adjustment to match Upload and Library tab heights
   - Needed to ensure proper scrolling behavior for library items

2. Button UI:
   - Had to balance between usability and minimal design
   - Ensured icons were sufficiently clear without text labels

## Next Steps
1. Test video recording functionality thoroughly
2. Consider adding tooltips for icon-only buttons
3. Review and test library scrolling behavior with larger lists
4. Consider adding loading states for video export

## Notes
- The video recording feature uses the MediaRecorder API with WebM/VP9 codec
- Current button layout: Play/Pause (flex-1) | Record | Reset
- Library panel uses 12rem minimum height to match drop zone
