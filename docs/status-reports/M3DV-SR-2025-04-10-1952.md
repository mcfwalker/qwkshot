# Status Report: UI Refinements & Merge to Main

## Summary
Completed final UI refinements from Phase 3, including fixing post-login redirects, dropzone states, Lock/Generate Shot button appearance/behavior, and disabled input styling. Identified and logged a bug related to Environmental Metadata capture (FOV not updating). Successfully merged the `feature/ui-refactor` branch into `main`. Cleaned up local and remote branches. Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` and reviewed `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Achievements
*   **Fixed Post-Login Redirect:** Updated auth callback and sign-in page to redirect to `/viewer` instead of `/library`.
*   **Fixed Drop Zone Styling:** Ensured drop zone border consistently uses accent green (`#C2F751`) for both hover and drag-active states.
*   **Refined Lock/Unlock Button:** Adjusted styling to use primary button variants, matched height/radius to Generate Shot button, ensured toggle behavior (not disabled when locked), fixed shadow issues. (Note: Known issue remains with tooltip/cursor on disabled state).
*   **Refined Generate Shot Button:** Removed hover scaling effect, shortened loading state messages to prevent wrapping.
*   **Standardized Disabled States (Partial):** Applied consistent visual style (`bg-[#444444] text-[#666666]`) to disabled Lock and Generate Shot buttons. Ensured `cursor-not-allowed` on Generate Shot (removed from LockButton due to conflict). Dimmed disabled placeholder/text in prompt/duration inputs.
*   **Merged `feature/ui-refactor` to `main`:** Completed cautious merge process including backup, dry run, testing, and commit.
*   **Branch Cleanup:** Deleted stale local and remote feature branches.
*   **Documentation Updated:** Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect progress, logged metadata bug. Reviewed `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Challenges
*   **Inconsistent Disabled State Behavior:** Significant difficulty getting consistent tooltip display and `cursor-not-allowed` style on the disabled `LockButton` compared to the `Generate Shot` button. The interaction between the base Shadcn `Button` component, the `disabled` attribute, and `TooltipTrigger` seems problematic. Reverted `LockButton` to use `disabled` attribute and accepted inconsistent cursor/tooltip for now.
*   **Metadata Capture Bug Identified:** Discovered that camera FOV is not being updated in stored environmental metadata upon re-locking. Logged as a bug.

## Next Steps
*   Create new feature branch from `main`.
*   Begin work on next priorities (API Auth, Scene Analyzer Integration, or Metadata Bug Fix).

## Notes
*   The UI functional testing tickets should now be clearable, with the known disabled state inconsistency logged as technical debt/bug.
