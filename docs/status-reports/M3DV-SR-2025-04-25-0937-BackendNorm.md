# Status Report: Backend Normalization Refactor Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-25
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-25-0937-BackendNorm

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Completed the implementation of the Backend Model Normalization refactor (Phases 0-5), moving geometry normalization (scaling, grounding, centering) from the client to the backend. Performed initial testing (Phase 6). Updated relevant documentation.
- **Key Achievements:**
    - **Infrastructure Fixes (Phase 0):**
        - Corrected storage path construction in `prepareModelUpload`.
        - Verified storage access strategy (Signed URLs) and added missing `UPDATE` RLS policy for storage objects, resolving upload errors.
        - Verified Next.js config (no changes needed for v15) and added `self` polyfill to fix server-side `SceneAnalyzer` execution.
    - **Backend Normalization Logic (Phase 1):**
        - Created new `normalizeModelAction` server action (`src/app/actions/normalization.ts`).
        - Installed and used `gltf-transform` library.
        - Implemented logic to download original GLB, calculate transforms (scale to height=2, ground at Y=0, center X/Z) based on original analysis, apply transforms via direct vertex manipulation (final working method), file writing (`io.writeBinary`), storage upload (`upsert: true`), re-analysis (`SceneAnalyzer`), and DB update (`scene_analysis` column).
    - **Client Refactor (Phase 2):**
        - Removed client-side normalization logic (scaling/translation/offset) from `<Model>` component in `Viewer.tsx`.
        - Modified `ModelLoader.tsx` to delay visual loading until backend normalization completes, preventing visual "snap".
    - **State/Metadata Updates (Phase 3):**
        - Removed `modelVerticalOffset` state/action from `viewerStore.ts`.
        - Updated `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx` (`handleLockToggle`) to save only `userVerticalAdjustment`.
        - Updated `EnvironmentalMetadata` / `EnvironmentalAnalysis` types to use `userVerticalAdjustment`.
    - **Interpreter Refactor (Phase 4):**
        - Updated `SceneInterpreterImpl` (`_resolveTargetPosition`, `_clampPositionWithRaycast`, motion generators) to use normalized `scene_analysis` data correctly and apply `userVerticalAdjustment` where needed.
    - **API Route Verification (Phase 5):**
        - Confirmed `/api/camera-path/route.ts` passes the correct normalized `sceneAnalysis` and `envAnalysis` (with `userVerticalAdjustment`) to the interpreter.
    - **Initial Testing Success (Phase 6):**
        - Models now visually load grounded correctly after initial upload.
        - Camera Reset button now targets the normalized model center correctly.
    - **Documentation:** Updated spec, architecture, and technical design docs.
- **Commit(s):** [Placeholder - Add relevant commit hashes]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:**
    - Added `src/app/actions/normalization.ts`.
    - Major changes to `normalizeModelAction` implementation (iterative debugging).
    - Modified `src/app/actions/models.ts` (path fix).
    - Modified `src/components/viewer/ModelLoader.tsx` (removed initial load, added normalization call, added final load).
    - Modified `src/components/viewer/Viewer.tsx` (removed client normalization in `<Model>`, fixed camera reset).
    - Modified `src/store/viewerStore.ts` (removed offset state).
    - Modified `src/components/viewer/CameraAnimationSystem.tsx` (updated metadata saving).
    - Modified `src/features/p2p/scene-interpreter/interpreter.ts` (updated target resolution, clamping, type usage).
    - Modified `src/types/p2p/environmental-metadata.ts` & `src/types/p2p/environmental-analyzer.ts` (replaced `modelOffset`).
- **Dependencies:** Added `@gltf-transform/core`, `@gltf-transform/extensions`, `@gltf-transform/functions`.
- **Configuration:** Added Storage RLS policy for `UPDATE` on `models` bucket. Added `self` polyfill.
- **Documentation Changes:**
    - Updated `docs/refactors/Backend-Normalization-Spec-2025-04-23.md` (status, checklists, notes, limitations).
    - Updated `docs/features/camera-animation/ARCHITECTURE.md` (offset handling, normalized data usage).
    - Updated `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` (store example, data flow, column descriptions, interpreter logic).

## Testing & Refinement Progress
- Initial testing confirms core backend normalization works: models are grounded visually, camera reset works.
- **Key Remaining Tests:**
    - User Adjustment slider functionality.
    - Locking mechanism saves correct `userVerticalAdjustment`.
    - P2P path generation with various prompts/constraints.
    - General regression testing.

## Challenges & Blockers
- **Normalization Logic Debugging:** Multiple attempts were needed to correctly apply the grounding transformation via `gltf-transform`. Direct vertex manipulation with explicit `setArray()` proved necessary, though the intermediate debug bounds check was unreliable.
- **Storage Permissions:** Initial uploads failed due to missing `UPDATE` RLS policy for storage objects, requiring a policy addition.
- **Server Env Compatibility:** Server-side re-analysis initially failed (`self is not defined`) requiring a polyfill.
- **Client Loading Flow:** Initial implementation showed ungrounded model briefly; fixed by delaying visual load until after normalization.

## Next Steps
1.  **Complete Phase 6 Testing:** Thoroughly test user adjustment, locking, P2P path generation, and perform general regression testing.
2.  **Fix Bounding Box Helper:** Update the logic for the yellow `Box3Helper` in `Viewer.tsx` to accurately reflect the bounds (Y=0 to Y=2) of the normalized model, likely by using data fetched from `scene_analysis`.
3.  **UX Improvements (Optional):** Refine loading indicators/messages during the save/normalization process.
4.  **Investigate Texture Warning (Low Priority):** Address the `Couldn't load texture blob` warning during server-side re-analysis if it causes issues.
