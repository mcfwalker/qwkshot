# Status Report: OpenAI API Authentication Resolution

## Summary
Investigated and resolved an OpenAI API authentication issue affecting the camera path generation feature. The issue was traced to an incorrectly formatted API key in the environment configuration.

## Achievements
1. Identified the root cause of OpenAI API authentication failures
2. Implemented diagnostic endpoints for API configuration verification
3. Successfully resolved the authentication issue
4. Added comprehensive documentation in the troubleshooting guide

## Challenges
1. Initial error messages were ambiguous between organization ID and API key issues
2. Debug logs weren't immediately visible in the server console
3. API key format verification required careful handling to avoid exposing sensitive data

## Resolution Steps
1. Created diagnostic endpoints to verify environment configuration
2. Identified incorrect API key format in `.env.local`
3. Updated API key with correct value from OpenAI dashboard
4. Verified functionality with test endpoint before full feature testing
5. Added detailed logging to camera path route for future debugging

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for any similar authentication issues
2. Consider implementing automated environment validation
3. Review other API keys for potential similar issues

## Notes
- Added new section to troubleshooting guide for OpenAI API authentication issues
- Retained enhanced logging in camera path route for future debugging
- Documented the importance of immediate API key backup upon generation
