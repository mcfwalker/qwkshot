# Status Report: Canonical Descriptor Refactor Completion & Merge

**Date:** 2025-04-20
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-20-1828

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Completed testing and documentation for the Canonical Descriptors refactor, merged the feature branch into `main`. Investigated pedestal movement constraints.
- **Key Achievements:**
    - Completed final regression testing for canonical descriptor logic (distance, factor, overrides, goal-distance).
    - Investigated pedestal "up/down to edge" behavior, identifying viewport framing and `minHeight` constraints as factors. Deferred model normalization fix to a future task.
    - Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`, and `CANONICAL_DESCRIPTORS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` to reflect the completed refactor state (Phase 5 documentation).
    - Successfully created a Pull Request, passed CI checks, and merged the feature branch (`fix/p2p-post-refactor-bugs`) into `main`.
- **Commit(s):** [Link to merge commit - Placeholder, replace with actual commit hash]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:** No functional code changes in this session; focused on testing and documentation.
- **Documentation Changes:**
    - Updated `docs/features/camera-animation/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Refined Scene Interpreter description for parameter handling priority and helper functions.
    - Updated `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`: Aligned P2P Pipeline description (Section 5.1) with verified interpreter logic.
    - Updated `docs/refactors/CANONICAL_DESCRIPTORS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`: Marked Phase 4 as complete and relevant Phase 5 documentation tasks as complete.

## Testing & Refinement Progress
- Phase 4 (Testing & Refinement) of the Canonical Descriptors Refactor is **Complete**.
- Core functionality for distance/factor/pass_distance descriptors, overrides, goal-distance, and destination targets is verified.
- `fly_by` and `fly_away` motions retain placeholder logic as per the refactor plan.

## Challenges & Blockers
- Pedestal movements clamped by `minHeight` constraint prevent reaching the visual bottom edge of models positioned below y=0. This is expected behavior given current constraints but highlights the need for model position normalization (tracked separately).

## Next Steps
1.  **Branch for Model Normalization:** Create a new branch to implement the "Align model bottom with y=0" fix identified during testing.
2.  **Complete Phase 5 Docs:** Address the remaining JSDoc comments task in `SceneInterpreterImpl`.
3.  Continue with next high-priority feature or bug fix.
