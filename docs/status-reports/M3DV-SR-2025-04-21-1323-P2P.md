# Status Report: Model Normalization & Backend Target Fixes

**Date:** 2025-04-21
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-21-1323-P2P

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Investigated and resolved model positioning issues, ensuring models load grounded at y=0. Re-implemented manual vertical offset adjustment. Fixed backend target resolution logic to account for normalization.
- **Key Achievements:**
    - Identified that `Viewer.tsx` (using R3F) was the active component, not `ModelViewerClient.tsx`.
    - Implemented container-based normalization (scaling, grounding) within `Viewer.tsx`'s `<Model>` component.
    - Stored calculated `modelVerticalOffset` in Zustand store from `<Model>`.
    - Removed obsolete `modelHeight` state and UI from `Viewer.tsx`, `SceneControls.tsx`, `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`.
    - Re-introduced manual "Model Offset" slider (`userVerticalAdjustment` state) compatible with automatic grounding.
    - Fixed `Box3Helper` React update loop and ensured it tracks adjusted model position and clears correctly.
    - Diagnosed backend issue where target resolution (`object_top_center`, etc.) ignored `modelOffset`, leading to incorrect camera movements (e.g., pedestal stopping short).
    - Updated backend API route (`/api/camera-path`) to fetch and inject the correct `modelOffset` into the `EnvironmentalAnalysis` object.
    - Updated backend `SceneInterpreter` (`_resolveTargetPosition`) to correctly use the provided `modelOffset`.
    - Fixed logic bug in `pedestal` handler (`SceneInterpreter`) that caused steps to be skipped.
    - Added navigation to base `/viewer` route on "Clear Stage & Reset".
    - Merged feature branch (`feat/normalize-model-position` or similar) into `main`.
- **Commit(s):** [Placeholder - Add commit hash for normalization/offset fix] and [Placeholder - Add commit hash for backend target/pedestal fix]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:**
    - Significant refactor within `Viewer.tsx` to handle normalization and user adjustment.
    - Updates to props and state management in `SceneControls.tsx` and `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`.
    - Updates to type definitions (`EnvironmentalAnalysis`).
    - Critical fixes within backend `interpreter.ts` (`_resolveTargetPosition`, `pedestal` logic).
    *   Updates to backend API route `/api/camera-path/route.ts` to manage offset propagation.
- **Documentation Changes:** None in this session.

## Testing & Refinement Progress
- Manual testing confirmed models load grounded.
- Manual offset slider functions correctly and saves the combined offset on lock.
- Bounding box helper tracks model movement and clears correctly.
- "Pedestal up towards top edge" prompt now functions correctly relative to the normalized model.
- Further regression testing planned.

## Challenges & Blockers
- Initial confusion identifying the active rendering component (`Viewer.tsx` vs `ModelViewerClient.tsx`).
- Debugging the subtle logic flow error in the backend `pedestal` handler.
- Tracing the source of the incorrect offset value provided to the backend interpreter.

## Next Steps
1.  Continue thorough regression testing of camera path generation after these fixes.
2.  Address next high-priority feature or bug fix (e.g., making animation duration optional).
