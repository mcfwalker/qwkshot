# Status Report: TrackballControls Integration & Visual Roll Success

**Date:** 2025-04-29
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-29-1844-TrackballRollFix

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Resolve persistent visual roll animation failure. Test alternative camera control libraries. Implement visual roll using `<TrackballControls>`. Debug resulting animation artifacts.
- **Key Achievements:**
    - **Root Cause Confirmed:** Confirmed through extensive testing that both `<OrbitControls>` (even with `enabled=false` and Euler Hacks) and `<CameraControls>` (using standard API or `up` vector manipulation) actively interfere with or override manual quaternion/rotation updates needed for visual roll due to their internal state management and orientation stabilization logic.
    - **`<TrackballControls>` Integration:** Successfully replaced `<OrbitControls>` with `<TrackballControls>` in `Viewer.tsx` as the user-interactive control component.
    - **Visual Roll Implemented:** Modified `AnimationController.tsx` to correctly use `orientation` data from `CameraCommand` objects. Implemented conditional logic to use `Quaternion.slerp` for explicit orientation commands (roll) and `camera.lookAt()` for others (pan, tilt, orbit, etc.). This successfully enabled visual roll animation without being overridden by the (disabled) `<TrackballControls>`.
    - **Pan/Tilt Refinement:** Fixed an issue where pan/tilt animations using `lookAt` could appear curved by explicitly resetting `camera.up` to `(0, 1, 0)` before the `lookAt` call within `AnimationController`.
    - **Orbit Jitter Diagnosis:** Identified that orbit animations appear jittery due to linear interpolation between keyframe points combined with frame-by-frame `lookAt` calls. Confirmed this by temporarily removing `lookAt`, which stopped the jitter (but broke the orbit visually).
    - **Independent Fix (Ported from `main`):** Re-applied the JSON comment stripping logic to `OpenAIAssistantAdapter` on the new branch.
- **Commit(s):** [Placeholder - Add relevant commit hashes for Trackball integration and AnimationController fixes]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:**
    - `src/components/viewer/Viewer.tsx`: Replaced `<OrbitControls>` with `<TrackballControls>`, updated relevant props.
    - `src/components/viewer/CameraTelemetry.tsx`: Updated to calculate distance manually instead of using `controls.getDistance()` (API difference).
    - `src/features/p2p/scene-interpreter/interpreter.ts`: Re-enabled orientation calculation logic for `axis: 'roll'` within the `rotate` primitive handler.
    - `src/types/p2p/scene-interpreter.ts`: Added optional `orientation` field to `CameraCommand` type.
    - `src/app/api/camera-path/route.ts`: Updated API response serialization to include `orientation` data and handle the required `camera` object for the interpreter.
    - `src/components/viewer/AnimationController.tsx`: Implemented conditional logic to use `Quaternion.slerp` when `command.orientation` is present, and `camera.lookAt()` (with `camera.up` reset) otherwise.
    - `src/lib/motion-planning/providers/openai-assistant.ts`: Added JSON comment stripping (re-applied from `main`).
- **Branching:** Created new branch `feat/trackball-controls` from `main` after abandoning previous attempts on `feat/visual-roll-effect`.

## Testing & Refinement Progress
- **Roll:** Visual roll animation is now functioning correctly.
- **Pan/Tilt:** Smooth and level animation is restored after `camera.up` fix.
- **Orbit:** Still exhibits jitter due to linear keyframe interpolation + `lookAt`. This is the primary remaining visual artifact.
- **User Interaction:** `<TrackballControls>` confirmed working for basic user setup (rotate/tumble, pan, zoom).

## Challenges & Blockers
- **Orbit Jitter:** The current linear interpolation method in `AnimationController` for orbit paths causes visual jitter when combined with `lookAt`. Requires implementing curve interpolation (e.g., Catmull-Rom) for smoother results.
- **Trackball UX:** The user interaction feel of `<TrackballControls>` is different from `<OrbitControls>` (free tumble vs. constrained orbit). May require UX refinements or constraints for the user setup phase later.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement Curve Interpolation:** Refactor the `orbit` logic in `SceneInterpreter.ts` to generate fewer key points, and modify `AnimationController.tsx` to use `THREE.CatmullRomCurve3` (or similar) for position interpolation during orbits, followed by `lookAt`.
2.  **Test All Primitives:** Thoroughly re-test all motion primitives (dolly, zoom, etc.) with the current `AnimationController` logic (`lookAt` + `up` reset) to ensure they work correctly.
3.  **Implement Easing:** Add logic to `AnimationController` to map `command.easing` names to appropriate Three.js easing functions for interpolation.
4.  **Documentation:** Update technical design documents regarding the switch to `<TrackballControls>` and the conditional orientation logic in `AnimationController`.
5.  **Commit:** Commit the successful implementation and fixes.
6.  **(Future)** Address `<TrackballControls>` UX for the setup phase if needed.
