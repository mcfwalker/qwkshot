# LLM Provider Switching Feature Implementation and Bug Fix

## Summary
Successfully diagnosed and fixed an issue with the LLM provider switching feature in the admin interface. The fixes ensure proper state management between the UI, backend database, and the in-memory registry. The health panels now correctly display the active LLM provider after switching.

## Achievements
- Identified and fixed Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues in Supabase that were preventing database updates
- Enhanced LLM provider registry implementation to properly initialize providers from database state
- Implemented proper state synchronization between UI components, database, and memory
- Added event-based state refreshing to ensure UI reflects current provider state
- Optimized performance by replacing continuous polling with targeted event-based updates
- Fixed memory leaks by properly cleaning up event listeners
- Ensured consistent initialization of the LLM system across the application

## Challenges
- Cookie warnings persist due to internal Supabase Auth library implementation
- Multiple state management locations (in-memory, database, and UI) needed careful coordination
- Initial debugging was challenging due to the distributed nature of the state management
- RLS policies in Supabase required proper configuration for table access

## Next Steps
- Consider upgrading Supabase Auth libraries to resolve cookie warnings
- Create automated tests for the LLM provider switching functionality
- Document the LLM architecture and state management in the technical docs
- Consider implementing a more robust state management system using React Context

## Notes
- The feature is now working correctly in both the Admin UI and viewer health panels
- RLS policy implementation is a critical step for new Supabase tables
- The application architecture successfully maintains state between the client and server
- Cookie warnings in the terminal do not affect functionality and are related to Supabase's internal implementation
