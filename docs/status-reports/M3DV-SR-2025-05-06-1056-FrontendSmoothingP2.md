# Status Report: Frontend Animation Smoothing (Phase 1 & 2)

**Date:** 2025-05-06
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-05-06-1056-FrontendSmoothingP2

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Frontend, Animation, Smoothing, P2P Pipeline
- **Goal:** Implement frontend sequential animation smoothing (Phase 1: Basic Spline/LookAt) and corner blending (Phase 2) to improve visual fluidity of camera paths.

## Summary
Significant progress was made on improving camera animation fluidity. Phase 1 goals were achieved by refactoring `AnimationController` to use a new `PathProcessor` module. `PathProcessor` generates pre-sampled position paths using `CatmullRomCurve3`, and `AnimationController` uses this data combined with dynamic `lookAt` calls for orientation. Initial playback bugs related to clock management were resolved.

Work on Phase 2 (Corner Blending) commenced:
1.  Added logic to `PathProcessor` to detect sharp corners based on an angle threshold.
2.  Implemented blend point injection (`B1`, `B2`) around detected corners, calculating offset distances based on adjacent segment lengths and defined constants.
3.  Modified the backend `handleOrbitStep` handler to generate fewer waypoints (`anglePerStep = 45`) to provide more geometric space for frontend blending.
4.  Iteratively tested and adjusted frontend blending constants (`BLEND_OFFSET_FRACTION`, `MIN_BLEND_OFFSET`) and curve types (`centripetal`, `chordal`), analyzing detailed logs.

## Achievements
- **Phase 1 Complete:** Implemented basic Catmull-Rom position smoothing and dynamic `lookAt` orientation in `AnimationController` via `PathProcessor`.
- **Playback Bug Fixes:** Resolved issues with clock resets and dependency loops in `AnimationController` `useEffect`.
- **Phase 2 Blending Implemented:** `PathProcessor` now detects corners and injects blend points.
- **Backend Handler Tuned:** Reduced waypoint density for orbit commands.
- **Achieved Noticeable Blend:** The combination produced visually smoother transitions for dolly-to-orbit, albeit with artifacts.
- **Tagged Stable Point:** Tagged `v0.2.0-blending-beta1` representing functional blending with known artifact.

## Challenges
- **Subtle Initial Blending:** Initial Phase 2 blending was too subtle due to short subsequent segments limiting the blend offset calculation via `MAX_BLEND_OFFSET_FACTOR`.
- **Persistent "Dip" Artifact:** The current best state (`centripetal` curve, reduced backend density, frontend blend points) exhibits a noticeable "dip" or overshoot during the blend curve, common to Catmull-Rom splines.
- **Curve Type Failure:** Attempting to use `'chordal'` curve type resulted in incorrect path generation.

## Current State
*   The combined approach (frontend blending + reduced backend orbit density + `'centripetal'` curve) produces a **noticeable smooth transition curve** for dolly-to-orbit sequences while maintaining correct focus via `lookAt`.
*   The "dip" artifact remains the primary visual issue to address.
*   The current codebase reflects the revert back to the `'centripetal'` curve type after the failed `'chordal'` test.

## Next Steps (Post-Break)
1.  Review and potentially refine the blend offset calculation (constants `BLEND_OFFSET_FRACTION`, `MIN_BLEND_OFFSET`, `MAX_BLEND_OFFSET_FACTOR`) aiming to reduce the "dip" artifact.
2.  Consider alternative blend point calculation methods if simple constant tuning is insufficient.
3.  Perform broader end-to-end testing with various primitive combinations (e.g., involving pan, tilt) to assess the generality of the blending and identify if other backend handlers need waypoint density adjustments.
4.  Document the new constants and blending logic.
