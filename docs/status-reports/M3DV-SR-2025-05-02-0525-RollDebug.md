# Status Report: Roll Animation Debug & Branch Freeze

**Date:** 2025-05-02
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-05-02-0525-RollDebug

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Debugging orbit animation jitter and UI responsiveness issues encountered after implementing camera roll using `TrackballControls` on the `feat/trackball-controls` branch.
- **Goal:** Achieve smooth orbit animations while retaining the new roll capability.

## Achievements
- **Roll Implementation:** Visually functional roll animation was achieved by switching from `<OrbitControls>` to `<TrackballControls>` and handling orientation updates via quaternions in `AnimationController`.
- **Orbit Position Smoothing:** Implemented `CatmullRomCurve3` interpolation for orbit *positions* in `AnimationController`, successfully resolving the initial position jitter. This involved tagging orbit commands (`animationType: 'orbit'`) in `SceneInterpreter` and ensuring the tag propagated through the API route and frontend parsing.
- **Data Flow Confirmed:** Confirmed via logging that the `animationType` tag is correctly generated, serialized, received, and parsed across the backend and frontend.

## Challenges & Blockers
1.  **Incorrect Orbit Orientation:** Despite smooth position interpolation, orbit animations resulted in the camera arcing over/under the subject instead of maintaining a level path. This is attributed to the conflict between frame-by-frame `camera.lookAt()` calls (needed for other motions like pan/tilt) and the interpolated position along the curve. The planned fix (using quaternion slerp for orbit orientation) was not implemented yet.
2.  **UI Interactivity Delay:** A persistent issue where UI elements (hover states, input fields) become unresponsive for several seconds after locking the scene. This issue was linked to enabling/disabling `<TrackballControls>`, even after ensuring metadata saving was asynchronous.
3.  **Debugging Impasse (`useFrame`):** Crucial diagnostic logs placed within the `useFrame` hook of `AnimationController` failed to appear in the browser console during animation playback, preventing further diagnosis of the animation loop's state and the remaining orbit issues. The root cause for `useFrame` not logging/executing during playback remains unidentified on this branch.

## Decision: Freeze `feat/trackball-controls` Branch
- **Rationale:** The combination of the persistent UI freeze/delay linked to `TrackballControls` and the inability to effectively debug the animation loop (`useFrame` issues) created significant blockers. To avoid sacrificing progress on core product features, the decision was made to freeze the `feat/trackball-controls` branch.
- **Status:** The branch preserves the working roll implementation and curve interpolation code for potential future revisiting.

## Last Unsolved Issue (on branch)
- The primary blocker preventing further progress was the failure of `console.log` statements within the `AnimationController`'s `useFrame` hook to appear during animation playback, making it impossible to verify the internal state and flow of the animation loop.

## Next Steps (for `main` branch)
1.  Return development focus to the `main` branch, which utilizes the stable `<OrbitControls>`.
2.  Address outstanding tasks and features on the main product roadmap.
3.  Re-evaluate the priority and feasibility of the camera roll feature for a future iteration, potentially exploring alternative architectures (like separate setup/playback views) if `TrackballControls` proves too problematic.
