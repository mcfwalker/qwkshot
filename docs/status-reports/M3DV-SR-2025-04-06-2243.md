# Status Report: UI Styling Refinements (Phase 3 Continued)

## Summary
Continued Phase 3 UI/UX Refactor, focusing on refining the visual appearance of the main control panels (Navigation, CAST/MODEL, SCENE, Camera Path) to align more closely with Figma mockups. Addressed layout, spacing, padding, component styling, and fixed visibility issues.

## Achievements
1.  **Navbar Styling:** Updated the main navigation component (`Navigation.tsx`) styles (background, logo, link appearance) to match target design.
2.  **Left Panel Layout (`Viewer.tsx`, `ViewerContainer.tsx`):**
    *   Corrected layout to properly position CAST/MODEL (`ModelSelectorTabs`) and SCENE (`SceneControls`) panels vertically within a 200px wide container.
    *   Removed duplicate rendering of `ModelSelectorTabs` from `ViewerContainer`.
3.  **CAST/MODEL Panel (`ModelSelectorTabs.tsx`, `ModelLoader.tsx`):**
    *   Updated panel container styles (width, padding, background, rounding, gap).
    *   Adjusted title spacing.
    *   Styled dropzone (border, padding, alignment, icon).
    *   Styled Library button (removed icon, centered text, applied secondary styles).
    *   Resolved several complex spacing/padding issues to match layout.
4.  **SCENE Panel (`SceneControls.tsx`):**
    *   Updated panel container styles.
    *   Refined spacing between control groups and internal elements (labels, sliders, etc.).
    *   Updated button styles ("Add Texture").
    *   Fixed invisible `Switch` component by applying contrasting background colors for track/thumb.
    *   Updated labels ("Model Offset", "FOV").
5.  **Camera Path Panel (`CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`, `ShotCallerPanel.tsx`):**
    *   Refined panel, tab, button, input, and pill styles based on detailed feedback to closely match Figma.
    *   Resolved multiple spacing and border issues through iterative adjustments.

## Challenges
1.  **CSS Specificity/Defaults:** Debugging visual inconsistencies required inspecting component base styles (`card.tsx`, `button.tsx`, `switch.tsx`) and understanding how default styles interacted with Tailwind utility classes.
2.  **Layout Complexity:** Achieving precise spacing often required restructuring JSX and careful application of padding, margin, and gap utilities, involving some trial-and-error.
3.  **Git State Issue:** Encountered and resolved an issue where local file state did not reflect the expected state after a merge, requiring a branch reset and re-merge.

## Next Steps
1.  **Complete Phase 3:**
    *   Implement refined easing logic in `CameraAnimationSystem` playback.
    *   Thoroughly test UI functionality and appearance.
2.  **Address Backend Blockers:**
    *   Implement API route authentication.
    *   Integrate real `SceneAnalyzer`.
3.  **Merge** `feature/ui-refactor` to `feature/thin-llm-engine`.

## Notes
- UI styling is significantly closer to the target design.
- Focus should now be on the remaining functional aspect of Phase 3 (easing) and testing.
