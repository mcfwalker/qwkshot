**Date:** 2025-04-18
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-18-1830

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Completing core Assistants API pipeline refactor, documentation cleanup & standardization, merge preparation.
- **Key Achievements:** Successfully refactored qualitative distance logic, implemented robust spatial reference targeting, implemented "move to destination" feature, resolved zoom consistency issues, merged feature branch to main, performed extensive documentation cleanup and standardization.
- **Commit(s):** [Link to commit for distance refactor], [Link to commit for spatial/destination target], [Link to commit for zoom consistency], [Link to commit for documentation cleanup]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:**
    - Refactored qualitative distance logic in `SceneInterpreterImpl` into `_calculateEffectiveDistance` helper.
    - Updated `_calculateEffectiveDistance` to handle "large distance" terms more effectively and fix `medium_distance` bug.
    - Updated `_resolveTargetPosition` to handle standardized spatial target names (e.g., `object_top_center`).
    - Updated `dolly`, `truck`, `pedestal` generators in `SceneInterpreterImpl` to prioritize `destination_target` parameter over `distance`.
    - Updated Assistant instructions (`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF...txt` files) to support spatial targets, `destination_target`, and improved zoom consistency logic.
    - Updated `motion_kb.json` to include `destination_target` parameter and improved descriptions.
- **Documentation Changes:**
    - Created `docs/ai/assistant-references/` directory.
    - Implemented timestamped versioning for system instruction files.
    *   Updated `docs/ai/assistant-references/README.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/refactors/ASSISTANTS_API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` (moved TODOs, added sync risk).
    *   Updated `docs/refactors/P2P_OVERVIEW_V3.md` and moved/renamed to `docs/features/camera-animation/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    *   Archived outdated docs (`P2P_OVERVIEW_v2.md`, old `ARCHITECTURE.md`, old feature component READMEs: `prompt-compiler`, `llm-engine`, `scene-interpreter`, `environmental-analyzer`, `metadata-manager`, `viewer-integration`, `feedback`).
    *   Updated `docs/features/README.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/development/` files (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`, `BRANCH_STRATEGY.md`).
    *   Archived outdated `TESTING_STRATEGY_OLD_PLAN.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/PRD.md`.
    *   Archived `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/CRITICAL_PATHS.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/FOR_HUMAN.md`.
    *   Updated `docs/LLM_CONTEXT.md`.
    *   Standardized naming convention for key `.md` files (`ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md`).
    *   Created `docs/testing/REGRESSION_PROMPTS.md`.
    *   Created `docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`.
*   **Merge:** Successfully merged `feature/assistants-pipeline-refactor` into `main`.

## Challenges & Blockers
- Test suite (`npm run test`) revealed numerous pre-existing failures unrelated to the refactor work. Fixing these was deferred.
- Linter (`npm run lint`) showed many errors/warnings, also deferred.
- Manual updates are required on the OpenAI platform for Assistant instructions and KB file uploads when local reference files change.

## Next Steps
1.  **Fix Test Suite:** Prioritize investigating and fixing all failing tests identified by `npm run test` (See `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` / Asana task).
2.  **Address Linter Errors:** Clean up errors/warnings reported by `npm run lint`.
3.  **Resolve `npm audit` Issues:** Address security vulnerabilities.
4.  **Implement Remaining Motions:** Continue P2P pipeline development by implementing generators for `fly_by`, `fly_away`, `set_view`, `arc`, `reveal` (as per future enhancements in refactor plan).
