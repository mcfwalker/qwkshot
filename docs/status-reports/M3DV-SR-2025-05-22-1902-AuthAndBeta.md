**Author:** AI Assistant
**Version:** AuthAndBeta

## 1. Summary

This report details significant progress made towards preparing the application, now titled "QWK Shot", for a beta release. Key areas of focus include a complete overhaul of the authentication system to support magic links, a redesigned login page UI, critical bug fixes for camera behavior and production environment variables, and initial steps for beta user onboarding.

## 2. Achievements

### 2.1. Core Application & Bug Fixes
- **Camera Dolly Fix:** Resolved a critical bug where the "dolly out" command was malfunctioning due to issues in `clampPositionWithRaycast` logic concerning raycast hits and dynamic pullback offsets.
- **Production Supabase Credentials:** Addressed a production error ("Supabase URL or Service Role Key is missing") by guiding the addition of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to Vercel environment variables, enabling successful scene metadata storage.
- **Favicon & Open Graph:** Integrated `favicon.svg` and `og_image.png` into the application, updating `src/app/layout.tsx` metadata accordingly.
- **Application Title:** Officially changed the application title in metadata (browser tab, etc.) from "Modern 3D Viewer" to "QWK Shot".

### 2.2. Login Page & Authentication
- **UI Overhaul (`src/app/auth/sign-in/page.tsx`):**
    - Redesigned the login page with a new three-column layout: left column for the form and a background SVG graphic (`side_bar_graphic.svg`), and the right two-thirds for a background video.
    - Styled the form for a dark theme with accent color `#FEE3E5`, including input fields (`h-16`, `bg-black`, `border-[#383838]`) and buttons.
    - Replaced "Welcome Back" text with the `logo_pink.png` image.
    - Resolved placeholder text color issues by removing hardcoded styles in `src/components/ui/input.tsx`.
    - Iteratively refined form alignment (left-justified), graphic sizing (`bg-[length:auto_75%]`), and positioning (`bg-[center_130%]`).
    - Temporarily removed Google Sign-In and "Or continue with" separator for a cleaner initial magic link flow.
- **Magic Link Authentication:**
    - Implemented client-side magic link initiation via `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()` in `SignInContent.tsx`.
    - Added a "Sign in with Magic Link" button to the UI.
    - Configured Supabase "Site URL" (to `https://www.qwkshot.com`) and "Redirect URLs" (including `https://www.qwkshot.com/auth/sign-in` and localhost) to resolve domain mismatch and "otp_expired" errors.
    - Simplified the login UI to be exclusively magic-link based, removing password fields and the email/password sign-in flow for a streamlined beta experience.
    - Fixed a Vercel build failure (`useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary`) by re-enabling the `Suspense` component in `src/app/auth/sign-in/page.tsx`.

### 2.3. Beta Preparation
- **Access Control:**
    - Advised on Supabase Email provider settings ("Enable Signups" turned OFF) for a controlled beta.
    - Guided on manually adding new beta users to the Supabase `auth.users` table.
- **Data Duplication for Beta Testers:**
    - Provided SQL to copy `models` table records from an existing user to a new beta user.
    - Addressed and resolved unique key constraint violations on model names during the copy process by modifying copied names (e.g., `Model Name_copy_xxxx`).
    - Investigated and confirmed that existing Supabase Storage RLS policies for the "models" bucket (`((bucket_id = 'models'::text) AND true)`) are permissive enough to allow new users access to files referenced by the copied database records without needing to duplicate files in storage.

## 3. Challenges

- **Magic Link Debugging:** Diagnosing and resolving issues related to magic link domain mismatches and token expiration required careful attention to Supabase settings and client-side redirect logic.
- **Login UI Iteration:** Achieving the desired three-column layout with the oversized background graphic and correctly aligned form involved multiple iterations of CSS adjustments.
- **Build Failures:** Encountering and fixing the Next.js build error related to `useSearchParams` and `Suspense` boundaries.
- **Database Constraints:** Working around unique name constraints in the database when duplicating data for new users.

## 4. Next Steps

- **Thorough testing of the magic link authentication flow** on the production environment (`qwkshot.com`) by a registered beta user.
- **Monitor initial beta user feedback** on the login process and overall application.
- **Consider dynamic `emailRedirectTo`** for magic links to allow testing on preview/staging builds without redirecting to production.
- **Plan for future authentication options** (e.g., re-adding password, Google Sign-In) post-beta based on requirements.
- Continue with other prioritized feature development and bug fixes.

## 5. Notes

- The application is now significantly closer to a beta-ready state with a functional, albeit simplified, authentication flow and a polished login experience.
- The focus on a controlled beta allows for targeted feedback and issue resolution.
