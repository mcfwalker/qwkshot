## 1. Summary
This report covers a comprehensive session focused on refactoring "card panels" on the Library page, creating and styling Storybook stories for dialog elements, applying these styles consistently across the application, and performing a final round of TypeScript error and unused code cleanup. This work significantly enhances the UI/UX of the library and various modal dialogs.

## 2. Achievements

### 2.1. Library Page Enhancements (`ModelLibraryCard`, Tabs, Header, Grid)
*   **`ModelLibraryCard.tsx`**: Created a new reusable component for displaying models in the library, including its Storybook story (`ModelLibraryCard.stories.tsx`) and associated styling.
*   **Global Cursor Styles**: Added `cursor-pointer` to global `buttonVariants` in `button.tsx`. Resolved issues with `TabsTrigger` in `tabs.tsx` not inheriting this by refactoring `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx` and `Viewer.tsx` to use the shared `TabsTrigger`.
*   **`Viewer.tsx` Tabs**: Refactored "Model" / "Camera" tabs to use shared `Tabs` components, ensuring consistent `cursor-pointer` behavior.
*   **`library/page.tsx` Refactor**:
    *   Replaced old card structure with `ModelLibraryCard` via `ModelGridClient.tsx`.
    *   Refactored library page tabs ("MODELS" / "TEXTURES") to use shared `Tabs` components with `variant="default"` for underline style, matching viewer panel tabs.
    *   Replaced "LIBRARY" SVG header with an `<h1>` text element and styled it.
    *   Adjusted gap between header and tabs to `gap-14` (56px).
*   **`ModelGridClient.tsx` Updates**:
    *   Replaced Shadcn `Card` with `ModelLibraryCard`, mapping necessary props.
    *   Implemented `onEditClick` to trigger `ModelEditDialog` with `editingModel` state.
*   **Library Grid Styling (`.library-grid`, `.library-card` in `globals.css`):**
    *   Iteratively adjusted grid `gap`.
    *   Standardized skeleton card (`ModelGridSkeleton.tsx`) and `ModelLibraryCard` appearance by updating `.library-card` styles (`w-[312px]`, `max-w-[312px]`, `bg-[#1E1E1E]`, `rounded-xl`).
    *   Resolved persistent gap issues by defining the grid with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 312px);`, `gap: 20px;`, and `justify-start`.

### 2.2. Dialog & AlertDialog Storybook Stories & Styling
*   **`alert-dialog.stories.tsx`**:
    *   Created `DefaultOpen` and `WithTrigger` stories.
    *   Styled `AlertDialogContent` (`bg-[#1E1E1E]`, text colors), `AlertDialogAction` (primary button style), and `AlertDialogCancel` (ghost-like style), ensuring no focus outlines.
*   **`dialog.stories.tsx`**:
    *   Created `DefaultOpenWithCustomContent` and `WithTriggerAndCustomContent` stories.
    *   Updated to feature a single primary action button, consistent `bg-[#1E1E1E]` for content, and `text-[#e2e2e2]` with styled checkboxes.

### 2.3. Application-Wide Dialog Styling & Refinements
*   **Global Dialog Close Button**: Added `cursor-pointer` to `DialogPrimitive.Close` in `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`.
*   **`LibraryModelModal.tsx` ("Select Model")**:
    *   Styled dialog frame (`DialogContent`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogDescription`) to match Storybook.
    *   Restyled model list items to `bg-[#2E2E2E] hover:bg-[#343434]` with `text-[#e2e2e2]` and `cursor-pointer`.
*   **`TextureLibraryModal.tsx` ("Add Texture")**:
    *   Styled dialog frame.
    *   Restyled "Add New Texture" button to primary style, removing its `Upload` icon.
    *   Removed green hover border from texture thumbnails and added `cursor-pointer`.
*   **`ClearSceneConfirmDialog.tsx` ("Clear Scene")**:
    *   Refactored from `Dialog` to `AlertDialog`.
    *   Styled completely to match `alert-dialog.stories.tsx`, including content, action/cancel buttons, and checkbox.
*   **`ThumbnailPreviewModal.tsx` ("Preview" Dialog)**:
    *   Styled dialog frame.
    *   Converted footer buttons ("Download", "Set as Thumbnail") to standard `Button` components with primary action styling.
    *   Updated "Set as Thumbnail" button to show `Check` icon and "Thumbnail Saved!" text when `isSaved` is true.
*   **`ModelEditDialog.tsx` (Edit Model Dialog)**:
    *   Refactored to accept `open` and `onOpenChange` props for external control.
    *   Styled dialog frame and added a `DialogDescription`.
    *   **Integrated Enhanced Delete Functionality**:
        *   Added `onDeleteClick` prop.
        *   Implemented an in-dialog two-step confirmation flow for deletion, disabling the form during confirmation.
        *   Styled delete section elements (separator, text, initial "Delete Model" button, red "Confirm Delete" button) to match Figma mockups. Removed model name label.
*   **`ModelGridClient.tsx` (for `ModelEditDialog` Delete)**:
    *   Created `handleConfirmedDeleteFromEditDialog` to manage deletion (Supabase calls, toasts, UI updates) triggered by `ModelEditDialog`'s `onDeleteClick`.

### 2.4. Code Cleanup & TypeScript Error Resolution
*   **`ThumbnailPreviewModal.tsx`**: Removed unused `modelName` prop and its invocation.
*   **`ClearSceneConfirmDialog.tsx`**: Removed unused `Button` import.
*   **`ModelEditDialog.tsx`**: Removed unused `handleCancelDelete` function.
*   **`TextureLibraryModal.tsx`**: Removed unused imports (`X`, `Upload`, `DialogFooter`).
*   **`src/app/(protected)/library/page.tsx`**: Removed unused imports (`Suspense`, `Image`, `cn`).
*   **`src/components/library/ModelGridClient.tsx`**:
    *   Removed unused imports (`useMemo`, `Image`, `Card` components, `Trash2`, `Box` icons, `AlertDialog` and its sub-components).
    *   Removed unused state variables (`imageErrors`, `modelToDelete`, `isDeleteDialogOpen`).
    *   Removed unused functions (`handleImageError`, `openDeleteDialog`).
    *   Removed obsolete `AlertDialog` JSX for the old delete flow.

## 3. Challenges
*   **Styling Consistency**: Ensuring consistent styling across various tab components (`TabsTrigger`) required careful refactoring to use shared components.
*   **Grid Layout**: Achieving the desired responsive grid layout with consistent spacing for model cards in the library involved several iterations on Tailwind CSS classes and ultimately a CSS `grid-template-columns` solution.
*   **Dialog Refactoring**: Transitioning `ClearSceneConfirmDialog` from a `Dialog` to an `AlertDialog` and integrating a new delete confirmation flow within `ModelEditDialog` required careful state management and prop handling.

## 4. Next Steps
*   Continue iterative UI/UX refinements across the application as needed.
*   Address any remaining TODOs or minor bugs identified during testing.
*   Expand Storybook coverage for other reusable components.
*   Begin planning for the next major feature or refactoring effort.

## 5. Notes
This session resulted in a significant overhaul and standardization of dialog components and the library page, leading to a more polished and consistent user experience. The extensive code cleanup has also improved codebase health and maintainability.
