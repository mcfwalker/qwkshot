# Status Report: Cookie Handling Fix

## Summary
Fixed synchronous cookie access issue in `/library` route that was causing warnings in the server console. The solution involved properly awaiting cookie access in the Supabase client initialization.

## Achievements
- Identified the root cause of synchronous cookie access warnings
- Implemented a solution that preserves functionality while eliminating warnings
- Improved the robustness of authentication handling in server components
- Documented the fix in troubleshooting guide

## Challenges
- Initially misdiagnosed the issue as related to session initialization
- Needed to understand Next.js App Router's cookie handling mechanisms
- Required careful type handling to adapt to Supabase client expectations

## Next Steps
- Monitor for similar issues in other routes
- Consider applying the same pattern to other server component clients
- Review for other instances of synchronous API access

## Notes
- The fix involved awaiting the cookies() function in createServerClient
- Created a custom cookie handler to ensure proper async cookie access
- This resolves an item previously documented in the troubleshooting guide
