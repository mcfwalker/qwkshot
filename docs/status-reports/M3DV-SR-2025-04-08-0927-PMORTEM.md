**Summary of the Problem:**

The core issue was that the camera animation, specifically an orbit around an object, was visually incorrect. Instead of the camera smoothly orbiting the object while keeping it centered, the object appeared to orbit a stationary (or only rotating) camera, or the animation looked jittery/stuck. This occurred despite extensive logging showing that:

1.  The backend API provided the correct sequence of `CameraCommand` objects, including the correct target coordinates (initially `(0,0,0)`, then the object center `(0,-0.03,0)` for subsequent commands).
2.  The client-side component (`CameraAnimationSystem`) received and stored this correct `commands` array.
3.  The interpolation logic within the animation loop correctly calculated the intermediate `currentPosition` and `currentTarget` vectors frame-by-frame based on the `commands`.

**Debugging & Failed Attempts:**

We tried several things that *didn't* work:

*   **Disabling/Modifying OrbitControls:** We tried disabling `OrbitControls` entirely during the animation and using `camera.lookAt()` instead of setting `controls.target`. We also tried *only* updating the camera position. None of these fixed the core visual glitch, although the logs confirmed the calculations *leading up* to the state application were correct. This ruled out simple interference from the controls overriding the state *after* calculation in each frame.
*   **Checking Data:** We confirmed the `commands` array wasn't being mutated unexpectedly during the animation.
*   **Removing Easing:** Simplifying the interpolation to linear didn't change the outcome.

**Root Cause & Solution:**

The breakthrough came when we realized the problem likely wasn't the *data* or the *calculation*, but the *timing and context* of how the calculated state was being applied to the Three.js objects.

*   **The Likely Culprit:** Running the animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` inside a standard React `useEffect` hook (outside the R3F `<Canvas>`) created a synchronization problem. This custom loop was essentially running "alongside" React Three Fiber's internal render loop, but not necessarily in lockstep. Applying direct manipulations to the `cameraRef` and `controlsRef` from this external loop likely led to race conditions or state inconsistencies. R3F might have been overwriting our updates with its own state before rendering, or our updates weren't properly integrated into the scene graph changes for that frame, leading to the visual errors despite the logged calculations appearing correct *at the moment they were logged*. The fact that `controls.target` was observably incorrect *after* we tried setting it pointed strongly to this kind of conflict.

*   **The Fix (`useFrame`):** We refactored the animation logic into a new component (`AnimationController`) rendered *inside* the R3F `<Canvas>`. This component uses the `useFrame` hook provided by R3F.
    *   **Why it Worked:** `useFrame` executes its callback function *synchronously within R3F's render loop*, just before each frame is rendered. By moving the interpolation calculations and the application of `camera.position.copy()` and `camera.lookAt()` inside `useFrame`, we ensure these operations happen at the correct time and context within R3F's update cycle. R3F is now aware of and correctly sequences these updates relative to its own internal state management and rendering pipeline. We also kept `OrbitControls` disabled during the animation (managed by a `useEffect` in `AnimationController` tied to the `isPlaying` state) to prevent interference, letting `useFrame` have exclusive control over the camera during playback.

Essentially, we moved from trying to "push" state updates into the R3F world from the outside to letting R3F "pull" the animation logic into its own synchronized update mechanism via `useFrame`.

**Next Steps:**

Now that the core animation is working, we should probably:

1.  **Remove Debug Logs:** Clean up the extensive `console.log` statements we added throughout `CameraAnimationSystem`, `AnimationController`, and potentially the API route.
2.  **Refine `AnimationController`:** Review the new component for any potential edge cases or further improvements (e.g., more robust pause/resume handling if needed, checking the `easingFunctions` import path).
3.  Continue with the original plan from `NEXT_STEPS.md`, focusing on resolving the lock/validation conflict and other Phase 3 UI tasks.
