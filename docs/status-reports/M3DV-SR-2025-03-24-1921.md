# Dynamic Params Implementation Status Report

## Summary
Successfully resolved Next.js dynamic route parameter handling issues in the viewer component and established standardized patterns for the entire application.

## Achievements
1. Fixed dynamic params warnings in viewer route
2. Implemented proper params awaiting pattern
3. Created comprehensive documentation
4. Verified solution works in both test and production routes

## Challenges
- Initial attempts to handle params as regular strings were unsuccessful
- Next.js 14 requires explicit awaiting of dynamic params
- Multiple locations needed consistent updates (generateMetadata, page component, error handling)

## Resolution Steps
1. Created test route to isolate and understand the issue
2. Identified params as Promise objects requiring await
3. Implemented consistent pattern across all dynamic param usage
4. Verified solution in both test and production environments

## Next Steps
1. Apply pattern to other dynamic routes in the application
2. Update development documentation and guides
3. Consider creating utility function for standardized param handling
4. Monitor for any performance implications

## Notes
- Solution follows Next.js 14 best practices
- Pattern should be considered standard for all future dynamic routes
- Font preload warnings remain but are not critical
