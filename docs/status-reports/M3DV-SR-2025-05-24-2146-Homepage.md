**Version:** Homepage

## 1. Summary

This report covers the development of a new homepage for the QWK Shot application and updates to the existing sign-in page UI. The primary goal was to create an engaging landing experience, facilitate waitlist sign-ups, and improve brand consistency. This work follows the authentication overhaul detailed in `M3DV-SR-2025-05-22-1902-AuthAndBeta`.

## 2. Achievements

### 2.1. New Homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **Two-Column Layout:**
    - Implemented a responsive two-column layout.
    - **Left Column (1/3 width):** Contains primary content, branding, and calls to action.
        - **Logo:** Integrated a responsive SVG logo (`side_bar_graphic_logo.svg`).
        - **Tagline:** Added the tagline "Super-simple LLM-powered cameraman for quick, easy hero shots and animations," styled with the custom "Mamoth" font.
        - **Waitlist Section:**
            - Styled "Waitlist" heading using the "Mamoth" font.
            - Implemented a descriptive paragraph and a "Join the waitlist" button.
            - Created `WaitlistModal.tsx` component using Shadcn UI Dialog for email capture.
            - Developed a Supabase server action (`src/app/actions/waitlist.ts`) with Zod validation for adding emails to the `waitlist_entries` table. Successfully debugged RLS and query issues for the `anon` role.
            - Resolved React/Next.js `useFormState` to `useActionState` update.
            - Iteratively styled the modal and its input/button elements.
        - **Sign-in Link:** Added a "Sign in" text link navigating to `/auth/sign-in`, styled for consistency.
    - **Right Column (2/3 width):** Designed for visual engagement.
        - **Background Video:** Integrated a looping background video (`public/videos/B-Take3-202505241532.webm`).
        - **Vimeo Embed Frame:** Created a centered, styled container (`bg-zinc-900`, rounded, shadow) to house an embedded Vimeo video player.
        - Successfully embedded the Vimeo player iframe and its associated script (`https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js`) using `next/script`.
        - Addressed and resolved issues with centering the video frame and iframe content.
- **Styling & Responsiveness:**
    - Applied consistent padding and spacing throughout the left column.
    - Ensured responsive behavior for text, buttons, and layout elements across different screen sizes.
    - Utilized the custom "Mamoth" font (via `.use-mamoth-font` utility class in `globals.css`) for key branding text.

### 2.2. Sign-In Page UI Update (`src/app/auth/sign-in/page.tsx`)
- **Logo Update:** Replaced the previous image logo with a text-based "QWK SHOT" logo.
    - Styled with the "Mamoth" font and responsive font sizes.
    - The new logo links to the new homepage (`/`).

### 2.3. General UI & Functional Fixes (from previous sessions leading to this work)
- **Dropzone Styling:** Adjusted `ModelLoader.tsx` dropzone styling.
- **Button Consistency:** Unified "Add Model" button style in `SaveModelDialog.tsx`.
- **Camera Unlock:** Ensured camera unlocks on "Clear Stage" (`resetViewerSettings` in `viewerStore.ts`).

## 3. Challenges
- **Vimeo Embed Styling:** Ensuring the Vimeo iframe and its container were correctly centered and that the player's black bars (pillarboxing) were understood and addressed as best as possible (noting they are often player-intrinsic).
- **Responsive Layout Adjustments:** Iteratively refining Tailwind CSS classes to achieve the desired responsive behavior for the waitlist paragraph and button.
- **Server Action & Modal Integration:** Debugging Supabase RLS policies and React `useActionState` for the waitlist submission.
- **JSX Structure:** Correcting JSX structure for `next/script` placement to avoid linter errors.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Merge `feat/homepage` branch into `main`.**
- **Conduct thorough testing of the new homepage** across various devices and browsers.
- **Monitor waitlist sign-ups and gather user feedback.**
- **Potentially refine Vimeo player parameters** if further control over its appearance (e.g., black bars) is desired and achievable.
- **Continue with other prioritized features** for the QWK Shot application.

## 5. Notes
- The `feat/homepage` branch now contains a fully functional and styled homepage.
- The `Mamoth.otf` font and `zod` dependency were key additions for this feature.
- This work significantly enhances the initial user experience and brand presentation for QWK Shot.
