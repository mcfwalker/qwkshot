# Status Report: P2P Backend Refactor Phases 1, 2, 2.5, 2.7

## Summary
Completed significant refactoring of the P2P backend pipeline, implementing the Thin LLM Engine and Scene Interpreter Core structures. Integrated these components within the primary API route and validated the structural data flow using real context data fetching (temporarily bypassing RLS for testing). The backend now adheres more closely to the target architecture, separating concerns, although further refinements and full context integration remain.

## Achievements
1.  **Phase 1 (LLM Engine):**
    *   Created `ThinLLMEngine` class and associated types (`LLMResponse`).
    *   Encapsulated provider API call logic within the engine.
    *   Refactored `camera-path` API route to use the engine.
2.  **Phase 2 (Scene Interpreter):**
    *   Created `CoreSceneInterpreter` class and associated types (`CameraCommand`).
    *   Implemented detailed input path validation (`validateInputPath`) including checks for duration, values, speed limits, restricted zones, and angular velocity.
    *   Implemented placeholder output command validation (`validateCommands`).
    *   Added structure for path processing (smoothing via Catmull-Rom, basic easing).
3.  **Phase 2.5 (Backend Integration):**
    *   Integrated `SceneInterpreter` call into `camera-path` API route after `LLMEngine`.
    *   Ensured API route returns `CameraCommand[]` format or specific errors.
    *   Structurally integrated `PromptCompiler` call (using mock context initially).
    *   Validated component interaction flow via API testing.
4.  **Phase 2.7 (Real Context Integration):**
    *   Removed mock context data from API route.
    *   Implemented real data fetching using `MetadataManager` (and `EnvironmentalAnalyzer` call).
    *   Utilized service role key temporarily to bypass RLS for testing data fetching.
    *   Validated pipeline flow with (mostly) real context data, confirming expected behavior up to interpreter validation failures.
5.  **Documentation:** Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect progress and new phases.

## Challenges
1.  **RLS/Authentication:** API route testing required bypassing RLS using the service role key. A proper authentication strategy is needed for the API route before UI integration.
2.  **Mock/Placeholder Data:** Debugging required extensive use of mock data. The `SceneAnalysis` object used as input for `EnvironmentalAnalyzer` and `PromptCompiler` is still a placeholder derived from `ModelMetadata`, potentially limiting context accuracy.
3.  **Type/Integration Debugging:** Encountered several subtle type mismatches and integration issues requiring careful logging and iterative fixes (e.g., `constraints` propagation, `EnvironmentalAnalyzer` input structure).
4.  **Git State Discrepancy:** Ran into issues with local file state not matching Git history after a merge, requiring branch reset and re-merge.

## Next Steps
1.  **Phase 3: UI/UX Refactor:**
    *   Create `feature/ui-refactor` branch.
    *   Modify `CameraAnimationSystem` to call the updated API endpoint.
    *   Adapt UI logic to consume and play back the `CameraCommand[]` array.
    *   Refactor UI controls and feedback related to animation playback.
2.  **Address Blockers:**
    *   Implement proper authentication for the API route.
    *   Integrate the actual `SceneAnalyzer` component to provide real `SceneAnalysis` data.
3.  **Refinement (Phase 4 / TODOs):**
    *   Implement remaining validation checks (e.g., `restrictedAngles`).
    *   Refine smoothing/easing algorithms in `SceneInterpreter`.
    *   Address other TODOs noted in the code.

## Notes
- The backend pipeline is now structurally sound according to the refactored design up to the interpreter output.
- Focus shifts to adapting the UI (Phase 3) while acknowledging the need to resolve the API authentication and SceneAnalysis placeholder limitations.
- Careful testing will be needed during UI integration due to the change in API contract.
