*   **Completed Backlog Grooming:** Reviewed remaining Asana tasks (Prompting Improvements, Session Tracking, Health Monitoring, Model Thumbnails, Animation Storage, Texture Generation, Image-to-3D Generation). Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` with relevant new backlog items, mostly under Phase 4. Clarified the "Integrate Scene Analyzer" task.
*   **Fixed Texture Application Bug:** Diagnosed and fixed the issue where selected floor textures weren't applying. The root cause was the modal's `onClose` handler incorrectly resetting the texture state. Also fixed the subsequent texture tiling issue by adding `texture.needsUpdate = true`.
*   **Fixed Add/Remove Texture Button:** Implemented the toggle logic for the "Add Texture" / "Remove Texture" button in `SceneControls`.
*   **Fixed Toast Message Spam:** Removed the unnecessary toast message triggered on every "Model Offset" slider change.
*   **Fixed "Clear Stage & Reset" Bug:** Implemented the full reset logic, including clearing the model, resetting viewer state, resetting camera controls, and triggering a reset of `CameraAnimationSystem`'s local state via a counter prop. Fixed related modal focus issue.
*   **Fixed Video Download Filename:** Implemented dynamic filename generation (`ModelName-Take#-Timestamp.webm`) and ensured the `takeCount` resets correctly when the model changes. Corrected the separator consistency (using dashes).
*   **Toast Styling:** Attempted several approaches to apply custom styling based on mockups. Settled on using `richColors` combined with `toastOptions.classNames` and the `!important` modifier to override background, text, and icon colors/sizes. Set global position to `top-center`.
*   **Verified Pipeline Behavior:** Confirmed that loading models from the library correctly bypasses the `SceneAnalyzer` and uses stored metadata for path generation.
