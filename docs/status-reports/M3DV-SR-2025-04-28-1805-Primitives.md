# Status Report: Scene Interpreter Primitive Completion & Instruction Tuning

**Date:** 2025-04-28
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-28-1805-Primitives

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Implemented remaining primitive motion types (`rotate`, `move_to`, `focus_on`) in the Scene Interpreter. Iteratively debugged and refined OpenAI Assistant system instructions to resolve inconsistencies and parsing errors. Tested all implemented primitives.
- **Key Achievements:**
    - **Scene Interpreter Implementation:**
        - Added `case` logic to `SceneInterpreterImpl.interpretPath` for `rotate` (handling yaw/pitch, warning for unimplemented roll), `move_to` (handling instant cuts and smooth moves), and `focus_on` (handling target changes).
        - Enhanced `_resolveTargetPosition` to recognize and calculate coordinates for corner targets (e.g., `object_bottom_right_center`, `object_top_left_corner`).
        - Removed dead code related to obsolete primitives (`fly_by`, `fly_away`) from interpreter and helper functions (`_mapDescriptorToValue`).
    - **Assistant Instruction Refinement:**
        - Diagnosed recurring JSON parsing errors caused by the Assistant adding conversational text/markdown fences.
        - Iteratively updated system instructions (`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF... .txt`) based on test failures:
            - Reverted to concrete JSON schema example and removed markdown fences.
            - Clarified handling of no-op requests (mapping to `static`, except for `focus_on`).
            - Clarified `focus_on` behavior (should always run, defaults to `object_center`).
            - Clarified numeric override scope (excludes `angle`).
            - Reinforced requirement to include all mandatory parameters (like `direction` for `pan`).
        - Confirmed final instructions (`...1737.txt`) resolve parsing issues and lead to correct primitive/parameter generation.
    - **Motion KB Alignment:** Updated `motion_kb.json` for the `rotate` primitive to match implementation (added `very_fast` speed, more easings, made `axis` optional with default).
    - **Testing:** Successfully tested all implemented primitive motion types (`static`, `zoom`, `orbit`, `pan`, `tilt`, `dolly`, `truck`, `pedestal`, `rotate` [yaw/pitch], `move_to`, `focus_on`) using regression prompts.
- **Commit(s):** [Placeholder - Add relevant commit hashes]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:**
    - Major additions and refinements within `src/features/p2p/scene-interpreter/interpreter.ts`.
- **Documentation Changes:**
    - Created `docs/ai/assistant-references/SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF_2025-04-28-1617.txt`, `...1654.txt`, `...1730.txt`, `...1737.txt` during iterative refinement.
    - Updated `docs/ai/assistant-references/motion_kb.json`.
    - Updated `docs/ai/assistant-references/README.md`.

## Testing & Refinement Progress
- All currently defined and implemented motion primitives (`static`, `zoom`, `orbit`, `pan`, `tilt`, `dolly`, `truck`, `pedestal`, `rotate` [yaw/pitch], `move_to`, `focus_on`) have passed initial regression tests.
- Visual effect of `rotate` with `axis: 'roll'` remains unimplemented as noted in instructions.

## Challenges & Blockers
- **Assistant Instruction Sensitivity:** Multiple iterations were required to tune system instructions to achieve consistent, correct JSON output from the OpenAI Assistant, particularly for `focus_on` and `pan` primitives after recent changes.
- **Debugging Interpreter/Assistant Interaction:** Pinpointing whether errors originated from Assistant generation, JSON parsing, or interpreter logic required careful log analysis and iterative testing.

## Next Steps
1.  **Merge Branch:** Merge the current feature branch (`feat/scene-interpreter-primitives`) into `main`.
2.  **Branch for Roll Implementation:** Create a new branch dedicated to implementing the visual `roll` effect for the `rotate` primitive, including necessary changes to `AnimationController.tsx` and potentially `CameraCommand` type.
3.  **Implement Roll:** Develop and test the visual roll functionality.
4.  **Merge Roll.**
5.  **Plan & Implement Pattern Layer:** Define requirements and implement the motion pattern library (`compose_pattern` function, pattern KB, interpreter updates).
6.  **Blending & Transitions:** Investigate and implement smooth transitions between motion segments and potentially blending simultaneous motions.
