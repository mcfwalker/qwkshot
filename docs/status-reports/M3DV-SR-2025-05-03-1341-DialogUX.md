## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Modern 3D Viewer Application Dialog Components and User Experience
- **Goal:** Improve dialog components for better usability, consistency, and accessibility

## Achievements

### Add Model Dialog Enhancement
- Updated UI text from "Save Model" to "Add Model" for better clarity and consistency
- Changed input helper text to "Give your model a name..." for more explicit guidance
- Updated button label to match the new "Add Model" terminology
- Added proper DialogDescription component for improved accessibility

### Clear Scene Confirmation Implementation
- Created a new confirmation dialog that appears when users click the Clear button
- Implemented a "Don't show me this again" checkbox with localStorage persistence
- Modified the initial dialog design to have more balanced vertical spacing
- Added proper screen reader support with descriptive text
- Maintained consistent styling with other dialogs in the application
- Removed the double-click confirmation requirement in favor of a clear modal dialog

### Library Dialog Accessibility Improvements
- Added a DialogDescription component to the LibraryModelModal
- Provided clear instructions: "Choose a model from your library to load into the viewer"
- Fixed console warnings about missing accessibility attributes

### Code Organization
- Created separate ClearSceneConfirmDialog and ClearSceneConfirmPortal components
- Updated the BottomToolbar component to remove unnecessary confirmation state
- Modified the Viewer component to manage dialog visibility and localStorage preferences

## Technical Implementation Details
- Used localStorage for persistent user preferences (dialog confirmation)
- Implemented consistent dialog styling with the application's design system
- Followed accessibility best practices by providing descriptive text for screen readers
- Maintained same color and spacing conventions as existing dialog components

## Next Steps
1. **Additional UI Refinements:** Continue reviewing the application for similar UX improvement opportunities
2. **Accessibility Audit:** Consider conducting a comprehensive accessibility audit
3. **User Testing:** Collect feedback on the new dialog flows to validate improvements

## Notes
These improvements address both usability and accessibility concerns. The clearer terminology and confirmation dialog help prevent accidental data loss, while the accessibility enhancements ensure all users can effectively interact with the application. The localStorage implementation provides a good balance between persistence and simplicity for this preference setting.
