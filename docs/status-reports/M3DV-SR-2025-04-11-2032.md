# Status Report: Metadata & UI Fixes, Merge Attempt & Recovery

## Summary
This session focused on fixing issues related to environmental metadata capture, UI tooltip consistency, and related workflow bugs. We successfully fixed the FOV capture and tooltip display issues. An attempt to merge these fixes into main revealed pre-existing type errors on main. After recovering the branch history, we identified the root cause of a Scene Analysis integration issue (data not being saved correctly during upload) and prepared the codebase for the fix by cleaning up the main branch and creating a new feature branch.

## Achievements
*   **Fixed FOV Metadata Capture:** Modified `storeEnvironmentalMetadata` to accept the `fov` state directly, ensuring the correct value is saved upon locking.
*   **Improved Disabled Button Tooltips:**
    *   Resolved issues preventing tooltips from showing on disabled `LockButton` and `Generate Shot` buttons using conditional rendering and wrapper elements.
    *   Standardized tooltip appearance (style, position, timing).
    *   Ensured hover effects are correctly suppressed on logically disabled buttons.
    *   Prevented text selection on `LockButton`.
*   **Fixed "Create New Shot" Workflow:** Ensured the button correctly unlocks the camera and resets relevant states, while preserving the previous prompt in a dimmed state.
*   **Implemented Play Button Progress:** Added a visual progress indicator to the Play/Pause button, showing animation progress as a background fill. Fixed reset behavior on animation completion.
*   **Branch Management:** Committed fixes, attempted merge to main, diagnosed merge issues, recovered git history after incorrect amend/reset, and performed branch cleanup.
*   **Diagnosed Scene Analysis Storage Issue:** Investigated why the API route wasn't finding stored `SceneAnalysis` data. Traced the issue to the `uploadModel` service not receiving/saving the full serialized analysis object from the P2P pipeline's `processModel` step.

## Challenges
*   **Git History Recovery:** Encountered difficulties fixing incorrect commit amends and resets, requiring careful use of `git reset` and `git push --force-with-lease`.
*   **Type Errors on Main:** Discovered that the `main` branch contained unresolved type errors after a previous merge, complicating branching and resets.
*   **UI Tooltip Complexity:** Debugging tooltips on disabled elements proved challenging due to interactions between component libraries, the `disabled` attribute, and event propagation.
*   **Misdiagnosis of Metadata Issue:** Initially misdiagnosed the cause of the "metadata incomplete" error, focusing on caching and read timing before identifying the upstream storage failure during model upload.

## Next Steps
*   **Fix Type Errors on `main`:** Address the remaining type errors directly on the `main` branch.
*   **Implement Scene Analyzer Integration:** On a new branch (`feat/integrate-scene-analyzer`), correctly implement the storage and retrieval of the full `SceneAnalysis` object.
*   **Address API Authentication:** Implement proper user authentication/authorization for API routes.
