# Authentication Fixes and Deployment Optimization

## Summary
Fixed critical authentication issues in the Vercel deployment that were causing rate limit errors and preventing user logins. The issues stemmed from a combination of incorrect cookie handling, excessive authentication requests from the DevInfo component, and mismatched Supabase URL configurations. Implemented fixes for all these issues while ensuring the health panel remains visible even when API errors occur.

## Achievements
- Fixed authentication rate limiting issues by properly awaiting cookies in API routes
- Updated Supabase URL configuration to point to the Vercel deployment URL
- Optimized the DevInfo component to prevent excessive authentication requests:
  - Added rate limiting (minimum 10s between requests)
  - Implemented exponential backoff for retries
  - Improved error handling and recovery
- Made the health panel (DevInfo) visible even when API errors occur
- Updated TECHNICAL_DEBT.md to document Vercel-specific issues
- Added a comprehensive Vercel deployment section to the troubleshooting guide

## Challenges
1. **Rate Limiting in Supabase Authentication**: 
   ```
   AuthApiError: Request rate limit reached {
     __isAuthError: true,
     status: 429,
     code: 'over_request_rate_limit'
   }
   ```
   The DevInfo component was triggering cascading authentication requests on every route change, quickly hitting Supabase's rate limits.

2. **Cookie Handling in API Routes**:
   Despite fixing server component cookie handling, API routes were still using synchronous cookie access:
   ```
   Route "/api/dev-info" used cookies().get(...). cookies() should be awaited before using its value.
   ```

3. **Mismatched Supabase URLs**:
   The Site URL in Supabase was still set to localhost rather than the Vercel deployment URL, causing refresh token errors:
   ```
   Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found
   ```

4. **Missing Health Panel**:
   When API routes failed, the DevInfo component was hiding completely, removing important monitoring capabilities in production.

## Resolution
1. **Cookie Handling**:
   - Updated all API routes to use `await cookies()` instead of synchronous `cookies()`
   - Properly configured cookie handlers in Supabase client initialization

2. **DevInfo Optimization**:
   - Removed route change dependency to prevent excessive requests
   - Added rate limiting with 10-second minimum interval between requests
   - Implemented exponential backoff for retries (1s, 2s, 4s, etc. up to 30s)
   - Created fallback UI to show health panel even during errors

3. **Supabase Configuration**:
   - Updated Site URL to the Vercel deployment URL
   - Added proper redirect URLs for authentication callbacks
   - Ensured new user accounts were properly set up

## Technical Debt and "Hacks"
1. **No Critical Hacks Requiring Immediate Attention**:
   - No components or features were disabled
   - No security compromises were made

2. **Areas for Further Improvement**:
   - The DevInfo error handling could be further refined for production
   - Consider adding more comprehensive auth event monitoring
   - API routes could benefit from additional error handling and logging

## Next Steps
1. **Monitor authentication in production** to ensure rate limits aren't being hit
2. **Consider implementing proper password recovery** for better user experience
3. **Document the auth rate limiting issue** in the authentication documentation
4. **Review other components for excessive API calls** that might trigger rate limits

## Notes
- Incognito mode can be used as a temporary workaround if rate limits are hit
- Browser cookie/cache clearing is recommended for any users still experiencing issues
- All the fixes were implemented in a non-intrusive way, maintaining existing functionality
- The health panel now provides better visibility into system status even during API errors
