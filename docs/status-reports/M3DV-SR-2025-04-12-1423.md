# Status Report: Scene Analysis Integration Refactor

**Date:** 2025-04-12
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-12-1423

## Summary
This session focused on resolving the long-standing issue of incomplete `SceneAnalysis` data being persisted to the database. After identifying that client-side code was incorrectly handling database interactions for both model saving and environmental metadata updates, a significant refactor was undertaken. Database logic was moved server-side using Next.js Server Actions, and the database schema was updated with a dedicated `scene_analysis` column. Initial testing confirms the full `SceneAnalysis` data is now correctly serialized, stored, retrieved, and deserialized for use in the path generation pipeline.

## Achievements
*   **Diagnosed Root Cause:** Identified that client-side components (`ModelLoader`, `CameraAnimationSystem`, `viewerStore`) were incorrectly performing database operations, bypassing server-side logic and leading to incomplete data storage and permission errors.
*   **Implemented Server Actions:**
    *   Created `prepareModelUpload` server action (`src/app/actions/models.ts`) to handle initial model record creation, signed URL generation, and trigger full metadata storage using the service role.
    *   Created `updateEnvironmentalMetadataAction` server action (`src/app/actions/models.ts`) to handle saving environmental metadata server-side using the service role.
*   **Refactored Client-Side Logic:**
    *   Modified `ModelLoader.tsx` (`handleSaveModel`) to call `prepareModelUpload`, receive a signed URL, and upload the file directly to storage via `fetch`.
    *   Modified `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx` (`handleLockToggle`) to call `updateEnvironmentalMetadataAction` instead of attempting client-side storage.
*   **Database Schema Update:** Added a dedicated `scene_analysis` column (jsonb) to the `models` table.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization:**
    *   Defined `SerializedSceneAnalysis` and related types (`src/types/p2p/scene-analyzer.ts`).
    *   Implemented utility functions for serialization and deserialization (`src/features/p2p/pipeline/serializationUtils.ts`).
    *   Integrated serialization into `P2PPipelineImpl.processModel`.
    *   Integrated deserialization into the `/api/camera-path` route.
*   **Metadata Storage Logic:** Updated `SupabaseAdapter` (`storeModelMetadata`, `getModelMetadata`) to correctly save/retrieve data to/from the separate `metadata` and `scene_analysis` columns.
*   **State Management Fix:** Resolved "Cannot lock scene: No valid model loaded" error by refactoring `Viewer.tsx` and `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx` to pass `modelId` as a prop, ensuring state consistency.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Updated `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new Server Action architecture and database storage strategy.
    *   Updated `P2P_OVERVIEW_v2.md` to document the data persistence details for the `models` table columns.
    *   Documented the React "update during render" warning in `NEXT_STEPS.md`.

## Challenges
*   **Debugging Complexity:** Tracing the root cause involved analyzing client-side logs, server-side logs, database state, and multiple interacting components.
*   **Tooling Issues:** Encountered difficulties with the AI assistant reliably applying code edits, particularly those involving structural changes or deletions, requiring manual intervention or repeated attempts.
*   **State Management Subtleties:** Debugging the `modelId` mismatch required understanding React state update timing and prop drilling.
*   **Initial UI Performance:** Identified a significant UI freeze on initial load due to client-side pipeline initialization (deferred for later fix).

## Next Steps
*   **Confirm Path Generation:** Run end-to-end path generation test and verify server logs confirm deserialized `sceneAnalysis` is used by `EnvironmentalAnalyzer` and `PromptCompiler`.
*   **Code Cleanup:** Remove debugging `console.log` statements.
*   **Address UI Performance:** Investigate and fix the UI freeze issue during initial client-side pipeline initialization (documented in `NEXT_STEPS.md`).
*   **Internal Component Logic:** Verify that `EnvironmentalAnalyzer` and `PromptCompiler` internals are updated to fully leverage the rich `SceneAnalysis` data.
*   **Refine Serialization:** Add handling for omitted fields (`materials`, `symmetryPlanes`, `restrictedZones`) if necessary.
