# Status Report: UI Refactor Phase 3 - Playback Panel & Debugging

## Summary
Continued Phase 3 UI/UX Refactor, focusing on implementing the Playback panel UI based on Figma designs. Encountered and debugged significant issues with animation playback, leading to investigations into the p2p pipeline, prompt generation, and client-side animation logic. Added UI elements for stage reset and AxesHelper visualization.

## Achievements
1.  **Playback Tab Accessibility:** Removed the condition disabling the "Playback" tab trigger, allowing users to switch tabs freely (`CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`).
2.  **Playback Panel UI:** Implemented the new layout and styling for the `PlaybackPanel` component based on Figma designs:
    *   Structured into four main sections (Take Label, Play/Record, Speed Slider, Create New Shot).
    *   Styled the "Take Label" with a two-part layout, border separator, and text truncation.
    *   Updated Play/Pause and Download buttons to use primary variant, correct size, and 16px radius.
    *   Updated "Create New Shot" button to match secondary button styles (Library, Add Texture).
    *   Refined Playback Speed slider styling (spacing, height, tick marks).
    *   Removed "Clear Scene" button.
3.  **Clear Stage Button:**
    *   Added a "Clear Stage & Reset" button overlaying the viewer (`Viewer.tsx`).
    *   Styled the button according to specifications (ghost-like, specific size/padding/colors).
    *   Positioned the button at the bottom-center of the viewport.
    *   Implemented basic click confirmation logic.
    *   Made button visibility conditional on `modelUrl` (only shows when a model is loaded).
4.  **Camera Info Panel:**
    *   Added "Camera Info" label to the telemetry panel (`CameraTelemetry.tsx`).
    *   Made the panel collapsible, defaulting to collapsed.
    *   Repositioned panel to bottom-center, aligned vertically with DevInfo panel.
    *   Adjusted internal text alignment to left-align values.
5.  **Axes Helper:** Added `AxesHelper` to the scene (`Viewer.tsx`) to visualize the world origin (0,0,0).
6.  **Pipeline Sanity Check:** Confirmed via `curl` that the core `/api/camera-path` endpoint logic remained functional after initial UI changes, returning expected validation errors.
7.  **Lock Button Logic:** Disabled the "Lock Composition" button when no model is loaded (`LockButton.tsx`, `ShotCallerPanel.tsx`, `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`, `Viewer.tsx`).

## Challenges & Debugging Steps
1.  **Playback Stuttering/Flickering & Incorrect Motion:**
    *   **Symptom:** Animation appeared to start and stop instantly, or the object orbited a stationary camera instead of the camera orbiting the object. Downloaded videos were static.
    *   **Investigation 1 (Loop Termination):** Modified animation loop exit condition and dependencies (`CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`). *Result: Loop ran longer according to logs, but visual issue persisted.*
    *   **Investigation 2 (Target):** Logged `commands` array, confirming the `target` values were incorrect (near `0,0,0` instead of object center).
    *   **Attempted Fix 1 (Prompt - Target):** Refined system prompt to explicitly instruct LLM to target the calculated object center. *Result: Still incorrect target in output, LLM likely ignored instruction.*
    *   **Investigation 3 (Interpreter Target):** Confirmed `Scene Interpreter` was not modifying the target values.
    *   **Attempted Fix 2 (Prompt - Constraints):** Removed numeric constraints (height/distance) from the system prompt, focusing on start position and object center target. *Result: Target still incorrect in LLM output.*
    *   **Attempted Fix 3 (OrbitControls):** Disabled `OrbitControls` during animation and used `camera.lookAt()`. *Result: No change, issue likely not controls interference.*
    *   **Current Status:** Playback is visually incorrect (object orbiting/flickering) despite the backend pipeline completing and the animation loop appearing to run in logs. Root cause likely still within client-side animation logic application or potential LLM target generation failure.

2.  **Interpreter Validation Errors:**
    *   Encountered expected validation errors (speed, height, distance) due to LLM output not respecting constraints.
    *   Temporarily loosened/disabled constraints (`maxSpeed`, `maxDistance`, `maxHeight`) in `Scene Interpreter` (`interpreter.ts`) to allow paths to pass for testing frontend playback.
    *   Corrected an "Invalid easing function type" validation error in `validateCommands` (`interpreter.ts`).

3.  **Code Edit Failures:** Encountered issues where automated code edits were not applied correctly, requiring manual intervention or re-application (`interpreter.ts`, `CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`).

## Next Steps
1.  **Diagnose Playback Root Cause:** Add more granular logging inside the `CameraAnimationSystem` animation loop (`animate` function) to closely examine timing values (`startTime`, `elapsedTimeSinceStart`), interpolated positions, and targets frame-by-frame to understand why the visual output is incorrect despite the loop appearing to run.
2.  **Verify LLM Output Target (Again):** Re-confirm the *raw* LLM output target values via server-side logging in the API route, just to be certain the Interpreter isn't subtly altering them despite review.
3.  **Revisit Constraint Handling:** Once playback is fixed, decide on the best long-term strategy for handling the conflict between user-locked positions and calculated safety constraints (e.g., pre-validation in API route, preventing invalid locks in UI).
4.  **Refine Easing:** Implement actual easing function application during playback.
5.  **Implement Full Reset Logic:** Connect the "Clear Stage & Reset" button to fully reset viewer/application state.

## Notes
- The backend pipeline seems functional but the LLM isn't consistently following target instructions yet.
- The client-side animation playback logic in `CameraAnimationSystem` remains the primary suspect for the visual stuttering/incorrect motion, despite several fixes attempted.
