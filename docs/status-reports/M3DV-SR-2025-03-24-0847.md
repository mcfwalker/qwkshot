# Status Report: Branch Reorganization and Project Structure Update

## Summary
Completed major branch reorganization to align development structure with project requirements. Successfully transitioned the `feature/video-export` branch to become the new main development line and established a new feature branch for navigation enhancements.

## Achievements
1. **Branch Management**
   - Created backup of original `main` branch as `main-backup`
   - Successfully reset `main` branch to match `feature/video-export`
   - Force pushed updated `main` branch to remote
   - Verified all changes were properly synced with GitHub

2. **Feature Branch Setup**
   - Removed old `feature/navigation-enhancements` branch
   - Created new `feature/navigation-enhancements` from updated `main`
   - Successfully pushed new feature branch to remote

3. **Repository State Verification**
   - Confirmed all branches are properly tracked
   - Verified branch relationships and commit history
   - Ensured GitHub repository reflects local state
   - Validated branch structure matches project requirements

## Challenges
1. Had to handle existing `feature/navigation-enhancements` branch
   - Solution: Deleted and recreated from updated main branch
2. Required force push to update main branch
   - Mitigation: Created backup branch before force push

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of navigation enhancements
2. Review and update project documentation to reflect new branch structure
3. Consider archiving or removing unused branches
4. Start following new development workflow with updated main branch as base

## Notes
- All force pushes were properly coordinated and executed safely
- Backup of original main branch preserved in case of needed reference
- Current branch structure now properly reflects project's actual state
- Development can proceed with clean, well-organized repository structure
