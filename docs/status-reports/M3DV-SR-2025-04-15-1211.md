# Status Report: Scene Interpreter Refinements (Phase 3 Core)

**Date:** 2025-04-15
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-15-1211

## Summary
This session focused on completing the core refinement tasks for Phase 3 of the Assistants API refactor, specifically enhancing the robustness of the initial 8 motion types implemented in the Scene Interpreter. Work included improving parameter handling (target resolution, speed/easing interaction), integrating constraint checking within generators (height, distance, bounding box with raycasting), refining duration allocation (normalization), standardizing easing functions using the `d3-ease` library, and addressing various bugs and linter errors encountered during the process. The Phase 3 goal of having a reliable interpreter for a diverse set of core motions is now considered complete for this initial scope.

## Achievements
*   **Implemented Target Resolution:** Added `_resolveTargetPosition` helper in `SceneInterpreterImpl` to resolve targets like `object_center` and features from `SceneAnalysis`. Integrated into `zoom` and `orbit` generators.
*   **Implemented Speed Parameter Handling:** Added logic to `zoom`, `orbit`, `pan`, `tilt`, `dolly`, `truck`, and `pedestal` generators to use the `speed` parameter as a hint to select the final `effectiveEasingName`.
*   **Integrated Easing Library:** Replaced manual easing functions with imports from `d3-ease` via a new utility (`src/lib/easing.ts`). Updated interpreter and `AnimationController` to use the new utility.
*   **Refined Constraint Checking:**
    *   Implemented `_clampPositionWithRaycast` helper for more accurate bounding box collision avoidance.
    *   Integrated height, distance, and raycast bounding box checks into `dolly`, `truck`, `pedestal`, `zoom`, and `orbit` generators.
    *   Added a velocity check loop at the end of `interpretPath` to warn about excessive speed between commands.
*   **Refined Duration Allocation:** Added logic to `interpretPath` to normalize step durations based on `duration_ratio` if their sum doesn't match the requested total duration.
*   **Code Cleanup & Bug Fixes:** Corrected various implementation errors, syntax issues, and linter errors introduced during refactoring, including restoring accidentally deleted methods.
*   **Updated Planning Docs:** Marked Phase 3 refinement tasks as complete for the core 8 motion types in `ASSISTANTS_API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.

## Challenges
*   Several instances where automated edits failed to apply correctly or corrupted the code, requiring manual review and corrective edits (especially in `interpreter.ts` and `ASSISTANTS_API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`).
*   Encountered and deferred fixing a low-severity vulnerability in the `next` package dependency.

## Next Steps (Phase 4)
1.  **E2E Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing using diverse prompts to validate the Assistant -> Interpreter -> Commands flow for the implemented motion types.
2.  **Documentation:** Create documentation outlining the process for adding new motion types.
3.  **Refinement/Further Work (Post-Testing):** Address remaining Phase 3 TODOs (e.g., advanced clamping, duration adjustment based on clamping), implement complex motion types (`fly_by`, etc.), profile performance, enhance error handling.

## Notes
*   The core goal of Phase 3 (robust interpreter for initial diverse motions) is met. Focus shifts to validation and preparing for further expansion.
*   Decision made to defer implementation of `custom` axis for `orbit` until needed.
*   Decision made to defer adjusting step duration based on constraint clamping for now.
