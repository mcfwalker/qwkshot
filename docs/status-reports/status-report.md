# Modern 3D Viewer - Project Status Report

## Summary
The Modern 3D Viewer application has made significant progress, particularly in authentication setup and model management capabilities. We've successfully implemented user authentication with Supabase, created a functional model library, and resolved various technical issues along the way.

## Completed Tasks

### Authentication
- ✅ Implemented Supabase authentication system
- ✅ Fixed synchronous cookies API issue in Next.js 15
- ✅ Created custom sign-in form with proper error handling
- ✅ Added session management and persistence
- ✅ Implemented proper redirect flows after authentication

### Model Library
- ✅ Created model upload functionality with metadata support
- ✅ Implemented model storage in Supabase buckets
- ✅ Built model listing page with grid layout
- ✅ Added model deletion capability
- ✅ Fixed data refresh issues after model upload

### UI/UX
- ✅ Implemented navigation bar for app-wide navigation
- ✅ Added toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Improved error handling and messaging
- ✅ Made responsive UI elements

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Resolved Next.js 15 async cookies API issues
- ✅ Migrated authentication checks to server side
- ✅ Implemented proper database type definitions
- ✅ Fixed environment variable handling
- ✅ Optimized API routes with error handling

## Current Issues
- None blocking at the moment

## Next Steps

### 3D Viewer Enhancement
- [ ] Implement viewer page to display 3D models
- [ ] Add controls for camera manipulation
- [ ] Add lighting controls and environment settings
- [ ] Support for different model formats (glTF, OBJ, etc.)
- [ ] Implement screenshot or recording capability

### Model Management
- [ ] Add tagging system for models
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Create collections/folder organization
- [ ] Add model metadata editing
- [ ] Implement model version control

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Add user profile management
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add sharing capabilities for models
- [ ] Implement team/organization features

### Performance & UX
- [ ] Optimize model loading for large files
- [ ] Add progress indicators for uploads
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop upload
- [ ] Add thumbnail generation for models
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

## Technical Debt
- Review error handling strategy
- Improve API route organization
- Consider implementing better state management
- Add comprehensive testing suite

## Conclusion
The project has made substantial progress in establishing the core functionality of authentication and model management. The application now allows users to sign in, upload 3D models, and view them in a library interface. The next phase should focus on enhancing the 3D viewer capabilities and adding more sophisticated model management features.
