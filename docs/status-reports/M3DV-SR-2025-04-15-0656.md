# Status Report: Assistants API Adapter Implementation (Phase 1 Complete)

**Date:** 2025-04-15
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-15-0656

## Summary
This session focused on completing Phase 1 of the Assistants API refactor plan: implementing the LLM Engine adapter for the OpenAI Assistants API. We successfully created a new `MotionPlannerService` interface and the `OpenAIAssistantAdapter` implementation. This adapter handles the full Assistants API workflow (threads, runs, messages, polling) and returns a structured `MotionPlan` object. The adapter was integrated into the main API route, replacing the previous LLM engine call. Custom error handling and comprehensive unit tests (using Vitest) were also implemented and validated for the new adapter, resolving issues with mocking and timers.

## Achievements
*   **Defined `MotionPlannerService`:** Created the `MotionPlannerService` interface and `MotionPlan` types (`src/lib/motion-planning/types.ts`) as per the refactor plan, establishing a clean contract for motion planning providers.
*   **Implemented `OpenAIAssistantAdapter`:** Created the `OpenAIAssistantAdapter` (`src/lib/motion-planning/providers/openai-assistant.ts`) implementing the `MotionPlannerService`.
    *   Handles thread creation, message addition, run creation, and status polling.
    *   Parses and validates the JSON `MotionPlan` response from the assistant.
    *   Includes implementation for `validateConfiguration` and `getCapabilities`.
*   **Refined Error Handling:** Introduced custom error classes (`MotionPlannerError`, `AssistantInteractionError`, `MotionPlanParsingError`) in `src/lib/motion-planning/errors.ts` and updated the adapter to throw these specific errors.
*   **Implemented Unit Tests:** Created a comprehensive unit test suite (`src/lib/motion-planning/providers/__tests__/openai-assistant.test.ts`) for the `OpenAIAssistantAdapter` using Vitest, covering success paths and various error conditions. Resolved issues related to mocking the OpenAI client and handling fake timers.
*   **Validated Adapter Tests:** Confirmed that all unit tests specifically for the `OpenAIAssistantAdapter` are passing.
*   **Integrated Adapter into API:** Updated the API route (`src/app/api/camera-path/route.ts`) to use the new `OpenAIAssistantAdapter`, replacing the old LLM Engine and Prompt Compiler logic. The route now fetches configuration, instantiates the adapter, calls `generatePlan`, and returns the raw `MotionPlan` object.
*   **Updated Planning Docs:** Marked Phase 1 as complete in `docs/refactors/ASSISTANTS_API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.

## Challenges
*   Initial difficulties with Vitest mocking for the OpenAI client required several attempts to find a working strategy (settled on accessing mocks via the instance).
*   Interactions between fake timers and async polling loops required careful handling (solved via dependency injection of the timer delay function).
*   Numerous pre-existing failures in other test suites unrelated to the current work were observed.

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
1.  **Scene Interpreter Refactor:** Begin refactoring the `Scene Interpreter` (`src/features/p2p/scene-interpreter/`) to accept the `MotionPlan` object instead of the old `CameraPath` (keyframes) format.
2.  **Context Access:** Ensure the `Scene Interpreter` can correctly access necessary local context (SceneAnalysis, EnvironmentalAnalysis).
3.  **Implement Basic Motion Generators:** Implement the logic for 1-2 simple motion types (e.g., `static`, basic `zoom`) within the interpreter based on `MotionStep` data.

## Notes
*   The successful completion and testing of the `OpenAIAssistantAdapter` marks the end of Phase 1.
*   Failures in other test suites (MetadataManager, PromptCompiler, etc.) need to be addressed separately.
