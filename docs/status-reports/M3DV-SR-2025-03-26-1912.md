# Status Report: Playback Speed UI Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the playback speed control UI in the viewer component, improving visual clarity and user experience.

## Achievements
- Implemented visually distinct green tick mark for normal (1x) speed position
- Optimized label positioning and spacing for playback speed controls
- Standardized typography and number formatting (0.25x and 2.0x)
- Improved visual hierarchy with proper vertical spacing
- Enhanced slider interaction with clear step marks

## Challenges
- Required multiple iterations to achieve optimal label positioning
- Balanced information density with clean UI principles
- Needed to coordinate multiple styling approaches (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, CSS)

## Next Steps
- Test UI responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Verify accessibility of the speed control
- Consider adding tooltips for speed values
- Document the styling patterns used for future reference

## Notes
- Changes focused on `PlaybackPanel.tsx` and `globals.css`
- Used existing component library (shadcn/ui) and Tailwind utilities
- No new dependencies introduced
- All styling changes maintain ghost-like UI aesthetic
