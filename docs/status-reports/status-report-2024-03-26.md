# Modern 3D Viewer - Project Status Report (2024-03-26)

## Summary
Today's work focused on addressing deployment issues with Vercel and recovering from a problematic deployment that affected core functionality. The team successfully reverted to a stable state and recommitted the video export feature with improved stability.

## Deployment Challenges

### Vercel Deployment Issues
- ❌ Initial deployment to Vercel failed due to routing conflicts
- ❌ Authentication callback route conflict between `page.tsx` and `route.ts`
- ❌ Static asset loading issues in production environment
- ❌ Environment variable configuration mismatches

### Functionality Loss
- ❌ Core viewer functionality became unresponsive
- ❌ Authentication system stopped working properly
- ❌ Next.js routing system conflicts emerged
- ❌ Static assets failed to load correctly

## Recovery Actions

### Immediate Response
- ✅ Identified auth callback routing as primary issue
- ✅ Documented all observed errors and their contexts
- ✅ Made decision to revert to last stable commit
- ✅ Successfully reverted to commit `9e1069d`

### Stabilization Steps
- ✅ Removed conflicting auth callback page
- ✅ Added debug logging throughout the application
- ✅ Fixed provider component initialization
- ✅ Improved error handling in core components
- ✅ Cleaned up package dependencies

### Feature Preservation
- ✅ Preserved video export feature implementation
- ✅ Maintained CameraAnimationSystem improvements
- ✅ Kept core functionality intact
- ✅ Retained all recent UI enhancements

## Technical Details

### Key Changes
1. Removed `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx` to resolve routing conflict
2. Added comprehensive debug logging in:
   - Auth context initialization
   - Provider component rendering
   - Page component mounting
   - Camera animation system
3. Updated package dependencies to ensure compatibility

### Current Status
- Application is now stable in local development
- Video export feature is functioning as expected
- Authentication system is working properly
- All changes committed to `feature/video-export` branch

## Lessons Learned

### Deployment Considerations
- Need for thorough pre-deployment testing
- Importance of maintaining consistent routing patterns
- Critical nature of environment variable management
- Value of comprehensive logging in production

### Best Practices Identified
- Implement staged deployment process
- Maintain detailed deployment documentation
- Establish clear rollback procedures
- Add more comprehensive error boundaries

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
- [ ] Implement comprehensive pre-deployment checklist
- [ ] Add production-specific error handling
- [ ] Create deployment environment variable guide
- [ ] Set up staging environment for testing

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add automated deployment tests
- [ ] Implement better route conflict detection
- [ ] Enhance logging and monitoring systems
- [ ] Create detailed deployment documentation

## Conclusion
While today presented significant challenges with the Vercel deployment, the team successfully recovered and improved the application's stability. The video export feature has been preserved and recommitted with better error handling and logging. This experience has highlighted the importance of robust deployment procedures and thorough testing processes.
