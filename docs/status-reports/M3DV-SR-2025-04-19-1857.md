# Status Report: Orbit/Zoom Refinements & Refactor Progress

**Date:** 2025-04-19
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-19-1857

## Session Overview
- **Focus Area(s):** Refined orbit and zoom logic within the Scene Interpreter, addressed transition issues, continued Phase 4 (Testing & Refinement) of the Canonical Descriptors Refactor.
- **Key Achievements:** Implemented `current_target` support for orbit, added goal-distance (`target_distance_descriptor`) handling for zoom, debugged related interpretation logic, updated refactor plan documentation.
- **Commit(s):** [Link to commit for orbit/zoom refinements - Placeholder, replace with actual commit hash]

## Technical Updates
- **Code Changes:**
    - `SceneInterpreterImpl`:
        - Modified orbit generator to accept `'current_target'` as a valid `target` parameter, preventing unnecessary blend/settle commands when the focal point is intended to remain the same between steps (e.g., zoom then orbit).
        - Modified zoom generator to handle `target_distance_descriptor` parameter. If present and no factor parameter is provided, the interpreter now calculates the required zoom factor based on the goal proximity defined by the descriptor (similar to dolly logic).
        - Corrected logic in zoom generator to prevent skipping the step when only `target_distance_descriptor` was provided.
    - System Instructions: Updated guidance for the LLM on when to use `target_distance_descriptor` for zoom (prompts implying end-state proximity like "zoom in close").
- **Documentation Changes:**
    - Updated `docs/refactors/CANONICAL_DESCRIPTORS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` to mark completed and partially completed tasks in Phase 3 and Phase 4, reflecting recent progress. Added status notes.

## Testing & Refinement Progress
- Phase 4 (Testing & Refinement) of the Canonical Descriptors Refactor is estimated at **~70% complete**.
- **Completed/Tested (Anecdotally):**
    - Basic functionality of distance/factor descriptors and overrides.
    - Goal-distance logic for `dolly` and `zoom` (using `target_distance_descriptor`).
    - `current_target` handling for `orbit`.
- **Pending:**
    - Comprehensive regression testing for all canonical descriptors and overrides across various object sizes and distances.
    - Systematic testing of spatial reference targeting (e.g., `object_top_center`).

## Challenges & Blockers
- None specific to this session's work.
- Full regression testing (as noted above) remains the primary pending task before concluding Phase 4.

## Next Steps
1.  **Complete Phase 4 Testing:** Execute comprehensive E2E tests covering all aspects of the Canonical Descriptors refactor (descriptors, overrides, goal-distance, spatial targets).
2.  **Tune Interpreter Mapping (if needed):** Based on Phase 4 testing, make any final adjustments to the descriptor mapping logic in `SceneInterpreterImpl`.
3.  **Proceed to Phase 5:** Update all relevant project documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`, JSDoc comments) to reflect the completed refactor.
