# Status Report: Camera Controls Integration - Phase 1 (Dolly)

**Date:** 2025-05-08
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-05-08-0942-P2P
**Branch:** `feat/frontend-smoothing-v3`
**Related Plan:** [Camera Controls Integration Plan (Attempt 3)](../refactors/CAMERA_CONTROLS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)

## 1. Summary
This report covers the work done for Phase 1 of the Camera Controls Integration Plan (Attempt 3). The goal was to replace the manual frontend animation interpolation (LERP) with the `@react-three/drei` `<CameraControls />` component for the 'dolly' primitive, aiming for smoother animations and transitions. Phase 1 involved refactoring the backend handler (`handleDollyStep`), the scene interpreter, the API route, and relevant frontend components (`Viewer`, `CameraAnimationSystem`, `AnimationController`, `PlaybackPanel`) to use a new `ControlInstruction` format instead of `CameraCommand` keyframes. The Dolly primitive now executes smoothly via `camera-controls`, respects the lock state, allows replay, and responds to playback speed adjustments. However, several challenges were encountered, leading to compromises on precise duration control and progress reporting.

## 2. Achievements
- **Basic Integration:** Successfully integrated `<CameraControls />` into `AnimationController`, replacing the previous manual LERP logic in `useFrame`. Manual camera interaction via the library works.
- **`ControlInstruction` API:** Defined and implemented the new `ControlInstruction` interface (`{ method: string; args: any[] }`) as the contract between the backend interpreter and frontend controller.
- **Backend Handler Refactor (`handleDollyStep`):** Modified `handleDollyStep.ts` to calculate the final camera state (position/target) including constraints, and output a single `ControlInstruction` targeting the `camera-controls.dollyTo(distance, true)` method.
- **Interpreter/API Update:** Refactored `SceneInterpreterImpl` to handle and return `ControlInstruction[]`. Adapted the target blending logic to use `setTarget` instructions. Stubbed out calls to un-refactored primitive handlers. Updated the `/api/camera-path` route to return the new instruction format.
- **Frontend Component Refactor:** Updated `Viewer`, `CameraAnimationSystem`, `PlaybackPanel`, and `AnimationController` to use the `instructions: ControlInstruction[]` state and prop types.
- **Animation Execution:** Implemented `async/await` logic in `AnimationController` using `useEffect` hooks to execute the received `ControlInstruction` sequence on the `camera-controls` instance.
- **Lock State Functionality:** Ensured manual interaction is disabled (`enabled` prop) and animation playback proceeds correctly when the scene is locked.
- **Replay Functionality:** Resolved a persistent issue preventing animation replay by implementing a robust reset pattern using `controls.saveState()` after setting the initial position/target and `controls.reset(false)` before each playback run.
- **Playback Speed Control:** Implemented approximate speed control by adjusting the `smoothTime` prop passed to `<CameraControls />` based on the `playbackSpeed` value.

## 3. Challenges
- **Replay Implementation:** Getting animations to replay correctly from the initial state proved very challenging. The stateful nature of `camera-controls` meant that simply re-executing instructions started from the previous end state. Multiple attempts were made:
    - Adjusting `useEffect` dependencies.
    - Explicitly resetting state via `setLookAt(..., false)`, `setOrbitPoint(...)`.
    - Adding frame delays (`requestAnimationFrame`).
    - Forcefully stopping transitions (`controls.stop()`).
    - None fully worked until the `saveState()` / `reset(false)` pattern was implemented, ensuring the library\'s internal default state was correctly managed.
- **State Synchronization:** Ensuring the library\'s internal state consistently reflected the application\'s intended state, especially across multiple playbacks or state changes, required careful effect management and leveraging the library\'s specific state methods (`saveState`, `reset`).

## 4. Learnings & Compromises
- **Stateful vs Stateless Animation:** This refactor highlighted the significant difference between our previous stateless, time-based keyframe interpolation and delegating control to a stateful, physics-based library like `camera-controls`. Replay and precise control require different approaches.
- **Duration Control:** Precise, guaranteed animation duration (matching user input exactly) is not feasible with the standard smooth transition methods (`dollyTo(..., true)`, etc.) and `smoothTime`. `smoothTime` provides approximate duration control, influenced by the physics simulation. The current implementation uses the user-provided duration, scaled by a factor and `playbackSpeed`, to influence `smoothTime`. *Decision:* Accept approximate duration control for now, focusing on smoothness. Consider UX changes (e.g., qualitative speed descriptors) instead of a precise numeric duration input.
- **Progress Reporting:** The fine-grained, time-based progress bar from the old system is lost. The current system only updates progress *between* instructions (i.e., after each `await` completes). Real-time progress *during* a transition would require complex polling or event handling from `camera-controls`. *Decision:* Defer enhanced progress reporting.
- **Easing:** Easing is now primarily handled by the `camera-controls` library\'s internal SmoothDamp algorithm (tuned by `smoothTime`). Per-command easing functions (like d3-ease used previously) are no longer applied directly to these transitions. *Decision:* Accept library\'s default smoothing; further tuning can be explored in Phase 3.

## 5. Next Steps (Paused)
Phase 1 (Dolly) is considered functionally complete, pending final review of minor issues. The next steps, currently paused, are:
- **Phase 2:** Incrementally refactor remaining primitive handlers (`handleOrbitStep`, `handlePanStep`, etc.) to output `ControlInstruction[]`, mapping parameters carefully to corresponding `camera-controls` methods (e.g., `rotateTo`, `truck`, `zoomTo`).
- **Phase 3:**
    - Thoroughly test sequences of mixed primitives (e.g., dolly+orbit, pan+tilt).
    - Evaluate and tune transition smoothness *between* different primitive instructions.
    - Tune global `camera-controls` parameters (`smoothTime` factor, potentially others like `draggingSmoothTime`).
    - Address known deferred issues: Initial camera focus on model load, \"Reset Camera\" button functionality.
    - Revisit/implement enhanced progress reporting if feasible.
- **Phase 4:** Polish, investigate advanced library features (boundaries, fitToBox), finalize UX related to duration/speed.

## 6. Notes
- All work is on the `feat/frontend-smoothing-v3` branch.
- The core goal of leveraging `camera-controls` for smoother *individual* primitive execution (like Dolly) and *potentially* smoother transitions between primitives has been partially validated for Dolly. Further testing is needed for sequences.
