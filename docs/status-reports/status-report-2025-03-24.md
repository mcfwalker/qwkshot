# Modern 3D Viewer - Project Status Report (2025-03-24)

## Summary
Today's work focused on improving the camera animation system and addressing issues with the floor texture upload functionality. We made significant progress in implementing natural language camera path generation and fixing the texture management interface.

## Completed Tasks

### Camera Animation System
- ✅ Restored natural language input for camera path generation
- ✅ Integrated OpenAI API for camera path generation
- ✅ Implemented scene geometry analysis for intelligent path finding
- ✅ Added smooth camera transitions with proper keyframe interpolation
- ✅ Fixed state update errors in animation playback
- ✅ Improved animation controls with play/pause and timeline scrubbing

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Refactored animation state management using refs to prevent render conflicts
- ✅ Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` for smoother animations
- ✅ Added proper camera position and target tracking
- ✅ Fixed "component update during render" error in `CameraAnimationSystem`
- ✅ Improved error handling in animation generation

### Floor Texture Management
- ✅ Fixed texture upload functionality
- ✅ Restored proper file dialog behavior
- ✅ Removed test upload functions
- ✅ Improved error handling for storage and database operations

## Current Issues
- Model height adjustment needed to prevent floor intersection
- Some optimization needed for camera path smoothness
- Need to implement proper error boundaries for animation system

## Next Steps

### Camera System Enhancement
- [ ] Add more natural language examples/templates
- [ ] Implement path preview before execution
- [ ] Add path saving/loading functionality
- [ ] Create more sophisticated scene analysis

### Model Management
- [ ] Implement model height adjustment controls
- [ ] Add model scaling options
- [ ] Improve model loading feedback

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor animation system for better state management
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add unit tests for camera path generation

## Conclusion
Today's work has significantly improved the camera animation system, restoring and enhancing the natural language path generation functionality. The floor texture system has also been fixed, providing a more reliable upload experience. The next phase will focus on refining these features and implementing additional model management controls.
