# Status Report: P2P UI Refactor (Phase 3) - Initial Implementation

## Summary
Began Phase 3 UI/UX Refactor for the P2P pipeline. Refactored the main control component (`CameraAnimationSystem`) to align with the new backend API contract (returning `CameraCommand[]`) and the target UI design featuring a tabbed interface. Extracted UI panels into sub-components and refined styling to closely match Figma mockups. Adapted core animation playback logic to handle the new `CameraCommand` structure.

## Achievements
1.  **API Integration:** Updated `CameraAnimationSystem` (`handleGeneratePath`) to fetch and parse `CameraCommand[]` from the `/api/camera-path` endpoint.
2.  **State Management:** Replaced `keyframes` state with `commands` state (`useState<CameraCommand[]>`).
3.  **UI Structure:**
    *   Implemented tabbed layout ("SHOT CALLER" / "PLAYBACK") using Radix UI Tabs.
    *   Added animation for tab transitions using Framer Motion.
    *   Extracted UI sections into `ShotCallerPanel` and `PlaybackPanel` components (improving separation of concerns).
4.  **Styling:**
    *   Applied specific styles (layout, spacing, colors, typography, button variants) to the panel, tabs, buttons, inputs based on Figma mockups, achieving ~85-90% visual parity.
    *   Resolved issues related to default component padding and borders.
5.  **Playback Logic:**
    *   Refactored main animation `useEffect` hook to iterate through `commands`.
    *   Refactored `handleProgressChange` (slider scrub) to work with `commands`.
    *   Implemented logic to look up and apply `command.easing` functions (placeholder easing currently used).
6.  **Branching:** Created `feature/ui-refactor` branch.
7.  **Documentation:** Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` to reflect Phase 3 progress.

## Challenges
1.  **Styling Precision:** Achieving exact Figma parity with Tailwind requires careful class selection and potentially theme customization (e.g., for specific border-radius or spacing values not in default scale).
2.  **Easing Implementation:** Playback logic now supports easing functions passed via `CameraCommand`, but the backend `SceneInterpreter` currently only provides basic easing names. Refinement needed for sophisticated easing.
3.  **Backend Limitations:** The UI refactor relies on the backend API, which still has known limitations (placeholder `SceneAnalysis`, reliance on Service Role Key for data fetching in tests).

## Next Steps
1.  **Finalize UI Styling:** Address any remaining visual discrepancies between the implementation and Figma mockups.
2.  **Refine Easing:** Implement more sophisticated easing function selection/generation in the `SceneInterpreter` and ensure they are correctly applied in the UI playback.
3.  **Test UI Thoroughly:** Perform comprehensive testing of the path generation flow, tab switching, playback controls (play, pause, scrub, speed), download, and clear/new shot functions.
4.  **Address Backend Blockers:**
    *   Implement proper API route authentication.
    *   Integrate real `SceneAnalyzer`.
5.  **Merge:** Merge `feature/ui-refactor` back to `feature/thin-llm-engine`.

## Notes
- The UI component `CameraAnimationSystem` is now structurally adapted to the refactored backend.
- Core functionality is in place, focus shifts to refinement, testing, and resolving backend limitations.
