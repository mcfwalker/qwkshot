## 1. Summary
Work continued on Phase 2 of the Camera Controls Integration Plan (Attempt 3). The goal was to replace the manual frontend animation interpolation (LERP) with the `@react-three/drei` `<CameraControls />` component for the 'dolly' primitive, aiming for smoother animations and transitions. Phase 1 involved refactoring the backend handler (`handleDollyStep`), the scene interpreter, the API route, and relevant frontend components (`Viewer`, `CameraAnimationSystem`, `AnimationController`, `PlaybackPanel`) to use a new `ControlInstruction` format instead of `CameraCommand` keyframes. The Dolly primitive now executes smoothly via `camera-controls`, respects the lock state, allows replay, and responds to playback speed adjustments. However, several challenges were encountered, leading to compromises on precise duration control and progress reporting.

## 2. Achievements
- **Basic Integration:** Successfully integrated `<CameraControls />` into `AnimationController`, replacing the previous manual LERP logic in `useFrame`. Manual camera interaction via the library works.
- **`ControlInstruction` API:** Defined and implemented the new `ControlInstruction` interface (`{ method: string; args: any[] }`) as the contract between the backend interpreter and frontend controller.
- **Backend Handler Refactor (`handleDollyStep`):** Modified `handleDollyStep.ts` to calculate the final camera state (position/target) including constraints, and output a single `ControlInstruction` targeting the `camera-controls.dollyTo(distance, true)` method.
- **Interpreter/API Update:** Refactored `SceneInterpreterImpl` to handle and return `ControlInstruction[]`. Adapted the target blending logic to use `setTarget` instructions. Stubbed out calls to un-refactored primitive handlers. Updated the `/api/camera-path` route to return the new instruction format.
- **Frontend Component Refactor:** Updated `Viewer`, `CameraAnimationSystem`, `PlaybackPanel`, and `AnimationController` to use the `instructions: ControlInstruction[]` state and prop types.
- **Animation Execution:** Implemented `async/await` logic in `AnimationController` using `useEffect` hooks to execute the received `ControlInstruction` sequence on the `camera-controls` instance.
- **Lock State Functionality:** Ensured manual interaction is disabled (`enabled` prop) and animation playback proceeds correctly when the scene is locked.
- **Replay Functionality:** Resolved a persistent issue preventing animation replay by implementing a robust reset pattern using `controls.saveState()` after setting the initial position/target and `controls.reset(false)` before each playback run.
- **Playback Speed Control:** Implemented approximate speed control by adjusting the `smoothTime` prop passed to `<CameraControls />` based on the `playbackSpeed` value.

## 3. Challenges
- **Replay Implementation:** Getting animations to replay correctly from the initial state proved very challenging. The stateful nature of `camera-controls` meant that simply re-executing instructions started from the previous end state. Multiple attempts were made:
    - Adjusting `useEffect` dependencies.
    - Explicitly resetting state via `setLookAt(..., false)`, `setOrbitPoint(...)`.
    - Adding frame delays (`requestAnimationFrame`).
    - Forcefully stopping transitions (`controls.stop()`).
    - None fully worked until the `saveState()` / `reset(false)` pattern was implemented, ensuring the library\'s internal default state was correctly managed.
- **State Synchronization:** Ensuring the library\'s internal state consistently reflected the application\'s intended state, especially across multiple playbacks or state changes, required careful effect management and leveraging the library\'s specific state methods (`saveState`, `reset`).

## 4. Learnings & Compromises
- **Stateful vs Stateless Animation:** This refactor highlighted the significant difference between our previous stateless, time-based keyframe interpolation and delegating control to a stateful, physics-based library like `camera-controls`. Replay and precise control require different approaches.
- **Duration Control:** Precise, guaranteed animation duration (matching user input exactly) is not feasible with the standard smooth transition methods (`dollyTo(..., true)`, etc.) and `smoothTime`. `smoothTime` provides approximate duration control, influenced by the physics simulation. The current implementation uses the user-provided duration, scaled by a factor and `playbackSpeed`, to influence `smoothTime`. *Decision:* Accept approximate duration control for now, focusing on smoothness. Consider UX changes (e.g., qualitative speed descriptors) instead of a precise numeric duration input.
- **Progress Reporting:** The fine-grained, time-based progress bar from the old system is lost. The current system only updates progress *between* instructions (i.e., after each `await` completes). Real-time progress *during* a transition would require complex polling or event handling from `camera-controls`. *Decision:* Defer enhanced progress reporting.
- **Easing:** Easing is now primarily handled by the `camera-controls` library\'s internal SmoothDamp algorithm (tuned by `smoothTime`). Per-command easing functions (like d3-ease used previously) are no longer applied directly to these transitions. *Decision:* Accept library\'s default smoothing; further tuning can be explored in Phase 3.

## 5. Next Steps (Proposed Investigation Plan)

**Goal:** Ensure camera reliably targets the visual center of the model (Y=~1) for "Reset Camera", "focus on object_center", and as the pivot/final target for `orbit` operations.

1.  **Isolate `CameraControls` Behavior for "Reset Camera" (Continued):**
    *   Ensure main `<OrbitControls />` in `Viewer.tsx` is **completely commented out** (not just `enabled={false}`) to eliminate it as a variable.
    *   Verify that the "Reset Camera" button (triggering `AnimationController`'s reset logic with `setPosition(0,1.5,6)` then `setTarget(0,1,0)`) results in the reticle being visually and programmatically (via `controls.getTarget()`) at `Y=1`.

2.  **Isolate `CameraControls` Behavior for "Focus on Center":**
    *   With `<OrbitControls />` still commented out, after a successful reset (reticle at Y=1), test the "focus on the center of the object" prompt.
    *   **Action:** Refactor `handleFocusOnStep.ts` to return `ControlInstruction[]`.
        *   It should resolve `'object_center'` to target `Y=~1`.
        *   It should generate a simple `{ method: 'setTarget', args: [target.x, target.y, target.z, true] }` instruction (or `setPosition` + `setTarget` if framing adjustment implies movement).
    *   Update `SceneInterpreterImpl` to correctly call the refactored `handleFocusOnStep`.
    *   **Test:** Observe logs and visual outcome. Does it target Y=~1?

3.  **Re-test "Orbit Up" with Corrected Targeting Foundation:**
    *   If "Reset Camera" and "Focus on Center" reliably target Y=~1 (with `OrbitControls` out of the picture), then re-test "orbit up around object center".
    *   The sequence will be: Initial `setTarget` (by interpreter, if needed) -> `setOrbitPoint` -> `rotate` -> final `setTarget` (by handler).
    *   Observe the final reticle position.

4.  **If Targeting Y=~1 is Still an Issue:**
    *   Consider if `camera-controls` requires a specific "up" vector to be set or reinforced for its internal calculations to correctly maintain a non-zero Y target, especially after rotations.
    *   Investigate if any properties on the `<CameraControls>` component itself (e.g., related to target locking, polar/azimuth limits) might be influencing this.

5.  **Address `<OrbitControls />` Re-engagement (If it was a factor):**
    *   Once `CameraControls` behaves predictably on its own, re-enable `<OrbitControls />`.
    *   If it causes target jumps after animation, implement synchronization: when `isPlaying` becomes `false`, update `OrbitControls.target` to match the last target of the `CameraControls` animation.

This plan aims to first achieve stable and correct targeting with `CameraControls` in isolation, then re-integrate `OrbitControls` if it's causing issues.

## 6. Notes
- This detailed investigation into targeting is crucial before refactoring more primitives, as it's a foundational aspect of camera behavior.
