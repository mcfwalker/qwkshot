# Status Report: Pipeline Refactor Decision & Planning

**Date:** 2025-04-13
**Report ID:** M3DV-SR-2025-04-13-2009

## Summary
This session focused on addressing the remaining issues with the backend bounding box validation and client-side retry mechanism. We successfully diagnosed and fixed the logger instantiation within the Scene Interpreter, enabling detailed validation logs. This confirmed the bounding box check (`Box3.containsPoint`) is working correctly and triggering the client-side retry prompt as expected. We also validated that the "Try Again" mechanism successfully sends context back to the API, resulting in a new path generation attempt.

Recognizing the limitations and unreliability of the current approach (LLM generating raw keyframes and struggling with constraints), a significant strategic decision was made to refactor the core path generation pipeline. The new approach will leverage the OpenAI Assistants API with a dedicated Motion Knowledge Base (KB). The Assistant will handle high-level motion planning, generating a structured plan JSON, while a refactored Scene Interpreter will handle deterministic geometric execution and constraint enforcement locally using scene context. A detailed plan for this refactor was created.

## Achievements
*   **Diagnosed & Fixed Interpreter Logging:** Identified that `SceneInterpreter` was using a dummy logger due to factory function usage in the API route. Refactored the API route to instantiate `SceneInterpreterImpl` directly with the correct logger.
*   **Validated Bounding Box Check:** Confirmed via detailed logs that `SceneInterpreter.validateCommands` and `Box3.containsPoint` now correctly identify bounding box violations.
*   **Validated Retry Mechanism:** Confirmed the full client-side retry loop works: 422 error -> Toast prompt -> "Try Again" click -> API receives `retryContext` -> New path generated.
*   **Committed Fixes:** Committed the logging and validation fixes to the feature branch.
*   **Proposed Pipeline Refactor:** Analyzed the benefits and challenges of using the Assistants API with a Motion KB for planning and a local Scene Interpreter for geometric execution.
*   **Created Refactor Plan:** Initiated `docs/refactors/ASSISTANTS_API_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` outlining the goals, architecture, component roles, API schemas (Motion Plan JSON, Motion KB structure), and a phased rollout strategy for the refactor.
*   **Defined Schemas:** Finalized the JSON structure for the Structured Motion Plan (Assistant output) and the Motion Knowledge Base file.
*   **Updated Project Tracking:** Paused tasks in `NEXT_STEPS.md` and shifted focus to the new refactor plan document.

## Challenges
*   Scope of the planned refactor is significant, requiring careful planning and execution.
*   Need to research Assistants API specifics (pricing, latency, limits).

## Next Steps (Refactor Phase 0)
1.  **Research:** Investigate Assistants API pricing, latency, limits, and error handling details.
2.  **Assistant Setup:** Create the basic Assistant entity in the OpenAI platform/dashboard, upload an initial version of the `motion_kb.json` file, and note down the Assistant ID and File ID.
3.  **Branching:** Create the dedicated feature branch for the refactor (e.g., `feature/assistants-pipeline-refactor`).

## Notes
*   The browser warning regarding non-passive 'wheel' event listeners in `OrbitControls.js` was analyzed and deemed safe to ignore for now.
*   Identified external resources (ReCamMaster dataset, CameraCtrl visualization script) as potential references for future implementation phases of the refactor.
*   Confirmed the process for starting new sessions using `LLM_CONTEXT.md`, the new refactor plan, and the latest status report.

*This document will be updated at the end of each session to reflect progress and adjust priorities.*
