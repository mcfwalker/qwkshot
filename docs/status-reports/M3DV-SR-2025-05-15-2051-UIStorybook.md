**Version:** UIStorybook

## 1. Summary
This report details the progress made during the current development session, focusing on significant UI enhancements, Storybook integration for several key components, and important code cleanup. A strategic decision was made earlier to pause a complex refactoring of motion primitives due to emerging complexities (like a camera reset issue) and to pivot towards UI improvements on a new branch (`feature/ui-update`) to ensure stability and allow for focused component development.

## 2. Achievements

### 2.1. Pivotal Decision & Branching Strategy
*   **Paused Motion Primitive Refactor:** The ongoing refactor of motion primitives (e.g., `handlePanStep.ts` to use `ControlInstruction[]` and `PanStepResult`, updates to `SceneInterpreterImpl`) was temporarily halted after encountering a persistent "reset camera" (recenter) issue that indicated deeper complexities.
*   **Switched to UI Focus:** To maintain momentum and address visual/UX goals, development switched from the motion primitive refactoring branch to a new branch, `feature/ui-update`. This allows for isolated UI development and Storybook integration, leveraging a stable base from `main`.

### 2.2. `CameraLockSwitch` Component (ShotCallerPanel)
*   **Storybook Development:** Created `CameraLockSwitch.stories.tsx` for iterative development and testing.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Container: Styled with `bg-[#2E2E2E]`, flex properties, `p-4`, and `rounded-md`.
    *   Radix UI `Switch`:
        *   Track: `h-[30px]`, `p-[3px]`, `w-[54px]`, `rounded-full`. Backgrounds `data-[state=checked]:bg-[#C2F751]` and `data-[state=unchecked]:bg-[#e2e2e2]`.
        *   Thumb: `h-6 w-6`, `bg-[#121212]`, `rounded-full`, with adjusted `translate-x` for the checked state.
*   **Componentization:** Extracted the styled switch into a reusable `CameraLockSwitch` component (`src/components/viewer/CameraLockSwitch.tsx`).
*   **Integration:** Successfully integrated `CameraLockSwitch` into `ShotCallerPanel.tsx`, replacing the previous inline implementation.

### 2.3. `BottomToolbar` Component
*   **Storybook Development:** Created `BottomToolbar.stories.tsx`.
*   **Storybook Fix:** Resolved an issue where the absolutely positioned toolbar was cut off by adding a decorator with `position: relative` and `minHeight` to the story.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Toolbar Container: Updated to `inline-flex`, `p-4`, `gap-6`, `bg-[#1E1E1E]`.
    *   Buttons: Refined to align with "primary" icon button style.
        *   Set to `variant="primary"` and `size="icon"`.
        *   Applied custom `rounded-[10px]`.
        *   Removed all explicit border styles (default and hover) to match the borderless nature of the defined primary button variant.
        *   Ensured the active reticle icon remains green (`text-[#C2F751]`), while other icons use the primary variant's default text color.
    *   Removed separator lines between buttons.

### 2.4. `TakeInfoDisplay` Component (PlaybackPanel)
*   **Storybook Development:** Created `TakeInfoDisplay.stories.tsx`.
*   **Styling & Functionality:**
    *   Component styled with `flex items-center h-[64px] rounded-lg bg-[#121212] overflow-hidden`.
    *   Ensured robust text ellipsis for long animation names by removing the `block` class and adding `w-full` to the text span, and verifying after a Storybook restart.
*   **Componentization:** Extracted into `src/components/viewer/TakeInfoDisplay.tsx`, removing its fixed width to allow flexibility within parent containers.
*   **Storybook Update:** The story was updated to import the extracted component and use a decorator to constrain width for testing ellipsis.
*   **Integration:** Successfully integrated `TakeInfoDisplay` into `PlaybackPanel.tsx`.

### 2.5. Code Cleanup & Linter Error Resolution
*   **`CameraLockSwitch.stories.tsx`:** Removed unused `CameraLockSwitchProps` import.
*   **`Navigation.tsx`:**
    *   Removed multiple unused icon imports from `lucide-react` (`ViewIcon`, `FolderOpen`, `LogOut`, `Home`, `Settings`).
    *   Removed unused `cn` utility import.
    *   Removed unused `pathname` variable and its `usePathname` hook import.
    *   Removed unused `handleNavigation` function.
    *   Removed unused `handleAdminNavigation` function.

## 3. Challenges
*   **Text Ellipsis Nuances:** Achieving correct text ellipsis for the `TakeInfoDisplay` component required a few attempts (adjusting Tailwind classes like `block` and `w-full`) and a Storybook restart to confirm the visual behavior.
*   **Storybook Absolute Positioning:** The `BottomToolbar`, being absolutely positioned, was initially clipped in Storybook. This was resolved by adding a decorator with a relative positioning context and minimum height.
*   **Button Style Alignment:** Iteratively refining the `BottomToolbar` buttons to precisely match the intended "primary button but icon-only" aesthetic, particularly regarding borders and hover states, involved checking base component styles.

## 4. Next Steps
*   Continue with UI refinements across other application panels and components.
*   Expand Storybook coverage to include more components, ensuring thorough testing of different states and props.
*   Address any remaining UI inconsistencies or bugs identified.
*   Once the current UI tasks are stable and satisfactory, re-evaluate and plan the resumption of the motion primitive refactoring.

## 5. Notes
The pivot to UI development has been productive, allowing for focused component work and leveraging Storybook for faster iterations and visual confirmation. The cleanup of unused code has also improved the maintainability of the affected files.
