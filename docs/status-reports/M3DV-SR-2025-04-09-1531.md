# Status Report: Animation Refactor & Bug Fixes

## Summary
A highly productive session focused on resolving critical bugs in the animation playback and recording systems introduced during recent P2P pipeline refactoring. The core visual playback glitch was fixed by refactoring the client-side animation execution to use R3F's `useFrame` hook. Several consequential bugs related to state management (playback replay, lock state, button states) and recording were also fixed. Documentation was updated, and several backlog tasks were analyzed.

## Achievements
1.  **Animation Playback Fix (Core Issue):**
    *   Diagnosed the root cause of incorrect visual playback (object orbiting camera, jitter) as a synchronization issue between the previous `requestAnimationFrame` loop and the R3F render cycle.
    *   Refactored animation execution logic into a new `AnimationController` component rendered inside the R3F `<Canvas>`.
    *   Implemented animation loop using the `useFrame` hook for proper synchronization with R3F (`AnimationController.tsx`).
    *   Lifted animation state (`isPlaying`, `commands`, `progress`, `duration`, `playbackSpeed`) and key refs (`cameraRef`, `controlsRef`) from `CameraAnimationSystem` up to the parent `Viewer` component (`Viewer.tsx`).
    *   Confirmed visually correct animation playback for generated paths.
2.  **Static Video Download Fix:**
    *   Resolved the issue where downloaded videos were static by forcing a manual render (`state.gl.render`) within the `useFrame` loop when recording is active (`AnimationController.tsx`).
3.  **Playback Replay Fix:**
    *   Fixed the bug preventing animations from being replayed after completion by correcting the state reset and re-initialization logic between `Viewer` and `AnimationController` (`AnimationController.tsx`, `Viewer.tsx`).
4.  **Lock State Fix:**
    *   Resolved the bug where OrbitControls remained enabled after path generation despite the scene being locked.
    *   Removed conflicting `useEffect` managing `controls.enabled` in `AnimationController`, allowing the `enabled` prop passed from `Viewer` (based on `!isPlaying && !isLocked`) to be the source of truth (`AnimationController.tsx`, `Viewer.tsx`).
    *   Confirmed camera controls are correctly disabled when locked, both after generation and when switching tabs.
5.  **Generate Button State Fix:**
    *   Fixed the issue where the "Generate Shot" button remained disabled after generating a path by resetting the `generatePathState` to `\'initial\'` after switching to the Playback tab (`CameraAnimationSystem.tsx`).
6.  **Duration Propagation Fix:**
    *   Corrected the pipeline logic to pass the user-requested `duration` from the API route through the `PromptCompiler` to the `LLMEngine`, replacing a hardcoded placeholder. Ensured the engine's keyframe duration scaling uses the correct target value (`prompt-compiler.ts`, `engine.ts`, `api/camera-path/route.ts`, associated types).
7.  **Documentation:**
    *   Created a detailed post-mortem document for the animation playback issue (`M3DV-SR-2025-04-08-0927-PMORTEM.md`).
    *   Updated `P2P_OVERVIEW_v2.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect the `useFrame` refactor, state lifting, and new `AnimationController` component.
    *   Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` with completed tasks, adjusted priorities, and added new backlog items based on Asana task analysis.
8.  **Backlog Grooming:**
    *   Analyzed several Asana tasks related to Environmental Analyzer, LLM Engine, Scene Interpreter, Interactive Orientation, Texture Generation, and Export Options.
    *   Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` accordingly and drafted Asana ticket descriptions.

## Challenges
-   Diagnosing the root cause of the animation playback glitch was challenging due to misleading logs caused by state synchronization issues between the custom animation loop and R3F.
-   Resolving the playback replay and lock state bugs required careful tracing of state updates and effect timings between parent (`Viewer`) and child (`AnimationController`, `CameraAnimationSystem`) components.

## Next Steps (Based on updated NEXT_STEPS.md)
1.  **Re-implement Slider Scrubbing:** Update `handleProgressChange` in `CameraAnimationSystem` to work correctly with the lifted state and potentially trigger camera updates via `AnimationController`.
2.  **Complete UI Functional Testing:** Thoroughly test all UI interactions (hover states, scene controls, drag-and-drop, etc.).
3.  **Address API Authentication:** Implement proper JWT or other auth for API routes.
4.  **Integrate Scene Analyzer:** Replace placeholder `SceneAnalysis` data with real results.

## Notes
- The core P2P pipeline functionality (prompt -> commands -> animation) is now working correctly after the `useFrame` refactor.
- The main remaining work for the UI refactor (Phase 3) involves scrubbing, hover states, and general testing/polish.
