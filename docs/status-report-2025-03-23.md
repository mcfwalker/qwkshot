# Modern 3D Viewer - Project Status Report (2025-03-23)

## Summary
Since the previous status report, significant progress has been made implementing the 3D Viewer floor enhancement features. We successfully created a complete floor texture management system, allowing users to upload, select, and apply custom textures to the floor plane in the 3D viewer.

## Completed Tasks

### Floor Enhancement
- ✅ Implemented three floor type options (Grid, None, Textured)
- ✅ Created a `floor_textures` database table in Supabase for texture metadata
- ✅ Set up a "floor-textures" storage bucket for texture files
- ✅ Configured Row Level Security (RLS) policies for database access
- ✅ Implemented storage bucket policies for file access and uploads
- ✅ Built texture upload interface with drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ Added texture selection grid with previews
- ✅ Implemented proper texture tiling for floor display
- ✅ Created documentation for storage security considerations

### Technical Improvements
- ✅ Fixed texture handling in the 3D viewer with proper texture repeat settings
- ✅ Improved error handling for storage and database operations
- ✅ Implemented texture thumbnail generation for the texture library

## Current Issues
- Storage security policies are currently set to allow broad access for development purposes and will need to be tightened before production
- The Supabase foreign key relationship for `user_id` to `auth.users` requires special handling through RLS rather than direct references

## Next Steps

### Complete Viewer Enhancements
- [ ] Implement lighting controls for the 3D scene
- [ ] Add environment settings (skybox, background options)
- [ ] Create camera path animations and controls
- [ ] Add screenshot and recording capabilities
- [ ] Implement model metadata display

### Model Management Improvements
- [ ] Enhance the tagging system for models
- [ ] Implement search functionality across models and textures
- [ ] Create collections/folder organization
- [ ] Add version control for models
- [ ] Implement model sharing capabilities

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Improve storage security policies before production
- [ ] Refactor texture handling for better performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all operations
- [ ] Implement client-side caching for textures and models

## Conclusion
The implementation of floor enhancement features represents significant progress in improving the 3D viewer's capabilities. Users can now customize the scene with different floor types and apply custom textures. This foundation will support the upcoming features like advanced lighting and camera controls.

The next development phase will focus on completing the core viewer enhancements before moving on to more advanced model management features.
