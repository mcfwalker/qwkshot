# 🎬 Cinematic Language to Camera Motion Model: Strategy Brief

## 🧠 Objective

To build an intelligent, modular system that **translates natural language instructions into structured camera motion**, enabling intuitive camera control in a 3D environment (e.g. Three.js).

This involves training a lightweight **LoRA (Low-Rank Adapter)** model on synthetic data, which interfaces with a **scene-aware camera interpreter** at runtime.

## 🧩 System Architecture

### 🔹 1. Language-to-Motion Model (LoRA)
- **Purpose**: Translate natural language into structured camera motion instructions.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Scene-agnostic
  - Trained on synthetic data
  - Consistent and predictable output schema

### 🔹 2. Scene Interpreter (Three.js Runtime)
- **Purpose**: Executes the instructions within the actual 3D environment.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Interpret camera plan relative to current scene
  - Adjust path based on:
    - Camera start position
    - Object locations
    - Scene dimensions
    - Collision boundaries
  - Handle animation, easing, timing

### ✅ Key Insight: Separation of Concerns

| Component            | Concern                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **LoRA model**        | Language understanding, motion intent    |
| **Scene Interpreter** | Real-world execution, physics, feedback  |

## 📦 Data Requirements

### 🔸 Structured Output Schema

The model should always emit camera plans in a structured, JSON-friendly format. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "dolly-in",
    "speed": "fast",
    "target": "object",
    "duration": 1.5,
    "easing": "linear"
  },
  {
    "type": "orbit",
    "direction": "clockwise",
    "easing": "ease-in-out",
    "radius": 3.0,
    "focus": "front"
  }
]
```

**Core Parameters to Capture**:
- `type` (action: dolly, orbit, pan, tilt, etc.)
- `direction`
- `speed` or `duration`
- `easing`
- `target` or `focus`
- `transitionFrom` (optional for sequencing)

## 🧪 Synthetic Data Strategy

### 🔹 Why Synthetic?
- No public dataset exists that captures cinematic language → structured motion translation.
- GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 can be used to **bootstrap high-quality data quickly** using prompt templates.

### 🔹 Method:
1. Write prompt templates (e.g. “Orbit slowly around the object, then zoom in from the top”)
2. Use GPT-4 to generate structured outputs
3. Review & clean as needed
4. Save in JSON or `.jsonl` format

### 🔹 Dataset Size Recommendations

| Objective            | Examples Needed |
|----------------------|------------------|
| MVP / Proof of Concept  | 500–2,000         |
| Solid Generalization    | 5,000–20,000+     |
| Production-Level Coverage | 50,000+       |

---

## 🚀 Training the Model

- Train a **LoRA adapter** on top of a strong base model (e.g. `Mistral-7B-Instruct`, `Phi-2`, or `LLaMA-2`).
- Use `transformers`, `peft`, and `datasets` libraries.
- Push model to Hugging Face Hub for sharing or app integration.

---

## 🔄 Runtime Flow

1. **User Input:** `"Pan right to reveal the skyline, then orbit upward into a top-down view"`
2. **LoRA Output:** Structured camera instructions (JSON)
3. **Three.js Engine:** Parses motion plan and executes it relative to current scene

---

## 💡 Future Extensions

- Inject scene metadata into prompts (object sizes, occlusions)
- Add “cinematic style” tags (handheld, drone, action)
- Build a real-time evaluation loop with collision/visibility feedback
- Previsualize camera paths before executing

---

## 📝 Summary

By splitting the system into two focused components — a language model for interpretation and a runtime engine for execution — you can build a highly flexible, scalable system that feels intelligent and cinematic.

This modular design makes your AI-driven camera operator reliable, extensible, and easy to fine-tune over time.
