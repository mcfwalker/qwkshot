# AI Assistant Reference Files\n\nThis directory contains reference files used by the OpenAI Assistant for motion planning.\n\n## Files\n\n*   `motion_kb.json`: This is the local source-of-truth and reference copy of the Motion Knowledge Base used by the Assistant. Changes made here MUST be manually uploaded to the OpenAI Assistant via the File API to take effect.\n*   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF_YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.txt`: Contains the plain text system instructions for the OpenAI Assistant. \n    *   **Versioning:** New versions of the instructions are saved in separate files with a timestamp suffix (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM`). The file with the **latest timestamp** represents the currently active instructions that should be configured in the OpenAI Assistant settings.\n    *   **Updating:** To update the Assistant's instructions, copy the entire content of the latest timestamped `.txt` file and paste it directly into the instructions field in the OpenAI Assistant configuration dashboard.\n\n## Current Instruction Versions\n\n*   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF_2025-04-18-1800.txt` - Added critical consistency check for zoom direction/factor.\n*   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF_2025-04-18-1700.txt` - Initial version with spatial reference mapping.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1.  **Modify Instructions:** To change the system instructions, create a **new** file named `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_REF_YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.txt` (using the current timestamp) with the updated instructions. Do **not** edit previous timestamped files.\n2.  **Update OpenAI:** Copy the plain text from the newly created file and paste it into the Assistant's configuration on the OpenAI platform.\n3.  **Update README:** Add the new file to the "Current Instruction Versions" list (newest first) in this README.\n4.  **Modify KB:** To change the Motion Knowledge Base, edit `motion_kb.json`.\n5.  **Upload KB:** Upload the updated `motion_kb.json` file to the OpenAI Assistant via the platform's File management section and ensure it's associated with the Assistant (replacing the old one if necessary).\n
